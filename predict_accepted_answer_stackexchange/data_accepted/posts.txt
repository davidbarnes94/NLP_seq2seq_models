1	What Does it Really Mean to Have Different Kinds of Infinities?	Can someone explain to me how there can be different kinds of infinities?I was reading "The man who loved only numbers" by Paul Hoffman and came across the concept of countable and uncountable infinities, but they're only words to me.Any help would be appreciated.	114
2	What is a Limit?	This limit thing keeps coming up in my calculus textbook.  What is it?	13
4	3	More or Less is a BBC Radio 4 programme about maths and statistics in the news, and there is a free podcast. It's presented by Tim Harford, the Undercover Economist from the Financial Times.	6
5	How can you prove that the square root of two is irrational?	I have read a few proofs that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.I have never, however, been able to really grasp what they were talking about.Is there a simplified proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational?	43
6	What is your favorite online graphing tool?	I'm looking for a nice, quick online graphing tool. The ability to link to, or embed the output would be handy, too.	35
7	5	You use a proof by contradiction. Basically, you suppose that $\sqrt{2}$ can be written as $p/q$. Then you know that $2q^2 = p^2$. However, both $q^2$ and $p^2$ have an even number of factors of two, so $2q^2$ has an odd number of factors of 2, which means it can't be equal to $p^2$.	60
8	How are we able to calculate specific numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence?	I was reading up on the Fibonacci Sequence when I've noticed some were able to calculate specific numbers. So far I've only figured out creating an array and counting to the value, which is incredibly simple, but I reckon I can't find any formula for calculating a Fibonacci number based on it's position.Is there a way to do this? If so, how are we able to apply these formulas to arrays?	28
9	1	Suppose no one ever taught you the names for ordinary numbers.  Then suppose that you and I agreed that we would trade one bushel of corn for each of my sheep.  But there's a problem, we don't know how to count the bushels or the sheep!  So what do we do?We form a "bijection" between the two sets.  That's just fancy language for saying you pair things up by putting one bushel next to each of the sheep.  When we're done we swap.  We've just proved that the number of sheep is the same as the number of bushels without actually counting.We can try doing the same thing with infinite sets.  So suppose you have the set of positive integers and I have the set of rational numbers and you want to trade me one positive integer for each of my rationals.  Can you do so in a way that gets all of my rational numbers?Perhaps surprisingly the answer is yes!  You make the rational numbers into a big square grid with the numerator and denominators as the two coordinates.  Then you start placing your "bushels" along diagonals of increasing size, see wikipedia.This says that the rational numbers are "countable" that is you can find a clever way to count them off in the above fashion.The remarkable fact is that for the real numbers there's no way at all to count them off in this way.  No matter how clever you are you won't be able to scam me out of all of my real numbers by placing a natural number next to each of them.  The proof of that is Cantor's clever "diagonal argument."	132
11	Is it true that $0.999999999\ldots = 1$?	I'm told by smart people that $0.999999999\ldots = 1$, and I believe them, but is there a proof that explains why this is?	197
13	1	The basic concept is thus:A 'countable' infinity is one where you can give each item in the set an integer and 'count' them (even though there are an infinite number of them)An 'uncountable' infinity defies this. You cannot assign an integer to each item in the set because you will miss items.The key to seeing this is using the 'diagonal slash' argument as originally put forward by Cantor. With a countable infinity, you can create a list of all the items in the set and assign each one a different natural number. This can be done with the naturals (obviously) and the complete range of integers (including negative numbers) and even the rational numbers (so including fractions). It cannot be done with the reals due to the diagonal slash argument:Create your list of all real numbers and assign each one an integerCreate a real number with the rule that the first digit after the decimal point is different from the first digit of your first number, the second digit is different from the second digit of your second number, and so on for all digitsTry and place this number in your list of all numbers... it can't be the first number, or the second or the third... and so on down the list. Reductio Ad Absurdium, your number does not exist in your countable list of all real numbers and must be added on to create a new list. The same process can then be done again to show the list still isn't complete.This shows a difference between two obviously infinite sets and leads to the somewhat scary conclusion that there are (at least) 2 different forms of infinity.	5
14	1	Just simple intuitive explanation.How many Natural (Integers) Numbers could you count?There are infinitely many, yet you can count them.It's called Countable Set.How many Real Numbers are there?Infinitely as well (Since at least every Natural Number is a Real Number).Yet you won't be able to count them (Intuitively, Let's say you name a number the first, then find the second, I can, for sure, find a number in between, their average which is Real Number as well). It's called Uncountable Set.What you are after is how we define how big is a given set.Then you should look for Cardinality.	-2
15	6	Well, I am not sure where you want to embed the graphs, but Wolfram Alpha is pretty handy for graphing. It has most of the features of Mathematica, can handle 3D functions, and fancy scaling and such. I highly recommend it.	15
16	5	Consider this proof by contradiction:Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then there exists some rational $R=\sqrt{2}=\frac{Q}{D}$, where $Q$ and $D$ are positive integers and relatively prime (since $R$ can be expressed in simplified form).Now consider $R^2 = 2 = \frac{Q^2}{D^2}$. Since $Q$ and $D$ are relatively prime, this means that only $Q^2$ can have $2$ in its prime decomposition, and the exponent must be one. Thus, $Q^2 = 2^1 x$, for some odd integer $x$. But $Q^2$ is a square, and thus the exponents for all of its prime factors must be even. Here we have a contradiction.Thus, $\sqrt{2}$ must be irrational.	18
17	8	Wikipedia has a closed-form function called "Binet's formula".http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Relation_to_the_golden_ratio$F\left(n\right) = {{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n} \over {\sqrt 5}}$This is based on the Golden Ratio.	18
18	How do you calculate the semi-minor axis of an ellipsoid?	Given the semi-major axis and a flattening factor, is it possible to calculate the semi-minor axis?	7
19	2	For many functions there are undefined values. For example in the function $$f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$$ there is no value of $f(x)$ for $x = 1$, since that involves a division by 0.In this instance though, as x gets closer and closer to 1, $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to 2, so we define that to be the limit.In calculus limits come up when getting the slope of a linear function as I'm sure you've seen, the problem is that getting the slope at a certain point, using the slope formula we all know, involves dividing by zero, so we use limits to get the answer. More specifically we create a formula for the slope between the point $(x, f(x))$ and the point $(x+h, f(x+h))$ and find the slope as $h \to 0$.Limits as $x \to \infty$ are also used often, since even if a function is well defined for all $x$ it is still impossible to simply plug in infinite and work it out, in this way it can be used for approximation purposes. Calculating the runtime of computer programs on large inputs is often done by deriving a formula for the run-time given input of a certain length, then finding the limit as $x \to \infty$	27
20	What is a real number (also rational, decimal, integer, natural, cardinal, ordinal...)?	In mathematics there seem to be a lot of different types of numbers. What exactly are:Real numbersIntegersRationals numbersDecimalsComplex numbersNatural numbersCardinalsOrdinalsAnd as workmad3 points out, some more advanced types of numbers (I'd never heard of)Hyper-realsQuaternionsImaginary numbersAre there any other types of classifications of a number I missed?	13
22	Why is the matrix-defined Cross Product of two 3D vectors always orthogonal?	By matrix-defined, I mean$$\left<a,b,c\right>\times\left<d,e,f\right> = \left|\begin{array}{ccc}i & j & k\\a & b & c\\d & e & f\end{array}\right|$$...instead of the definition of the product of the magnitudes multiplied by the sign of their angle, in the direction orthogonal)If I try cross producting two vectors with no $k$ component, I get one with only $k$, which is expected. But why?As has been pointed out, I am asking why the algebraic definition lines up with the geometric definition.	12
24	8	The closed form calculation for Fibonacci sequences is known as Binet's Formula.	4
26	8	You can use Binet's formula, described at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinetsFibonacciNumberFormula.html(see also Wikipedia for a proof: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binet_formula#Closed_form_expression )	3
27	2	A limit is the term used when you examine a function as it approaches some value. For example, the function $f(x) = \frac1x$. You can take a limit of this function as $x$ approaches infinity and as $x$ approaches $0$ and see what occurs, and get an idea of the behaviour of the function in these regions even though the function cannot be defined at the exact values you have taken limits of. ($\frac10$ is undefined, and $\frac{1}{\infty}$ cannot be done without adding infinity to the number system - see the hyperreals for this)	7
29	Can you recommend a decent online or software calculator?	I'm looking for an online or software calculator that can show me the history of items I typed in, much like an expensive Ti calculator. Can you recommend any?	31
30	11	Given (by long division):$\frac{1}{3} = 0.\bar{3}$Multiply by 3:$3\times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \left( 0.\bar{3} \right) \times 3$Therefore:$\frac{3}{3} = 0.\bar{9}$QED.	8
31	11	Indeed this is true. The underlying reason is that decimal numbers are not unique representations of the reals. (Technically, there does not exist a bijection between the set of all decimal numbers and the reals.)Here's a very simple proof:$$\begin{align}\frac13&=0.333\ldots&\hbox{(by long division)}\\\implies0.333\ldots\times3&=0.999\ldots&\hbox{(multiplying each digit by $3$)}\end{align}$$Then we already know $0.333\ldots\times3=1$ therefore $0.999\ldots=1$.	11
35	1	Hilbert's Hotel is a classic demonstration.	13
36	2	What others have provided is a pretty good intuitive/more general definition of a limit. If you want something a bit more technical and rigorous, have a look at the (ε, δ)-definition of limit, which is the one used in mathematical analysis.	9
38	29	Lots of people like to use Instacalc which lets you do unit conversions and store intermediate calculations in variables.	7
40	20	Natural numbersThe "counting" numbers.  (That is, all integers, that are one or greater).Whole numbersThe Natural numbers, and zero.IntegersThe Whole numbers, and the negatives of the Natural numbers.Rational numbersAny number that may be expressed by any integer A divided by any integer B, where B is not zero.Irrational numbersAny number that cannot be expressed as a rational number, but is not imaginary.  All irrational numbers have an infinite decimal representation.Real numbersAll of the Rational and Irrational numbers.Imaginary numbersAll Real numbers, multiplied by the square root of negative one.  Imaginary numbers are signified by the letter i.Complex numbersNumbers composed of the sum of a Real and an Imaginary number.  This includes all Real and all Imaginary numbers.	11
41	11	.999...  = 1 because .999... is a concise symbolic representation of "the limit of some variable as it approaches one." Therefore, .999... = 1 for the same reason the limit of x as x approaches 1 equals 1.	20
42	22	The obvious but slightly trite answer is "because that's just how the cross-product works as an operation".If you're looking for an intuitive reason, the cross-product by definition produces a vector that is orthogonal to the two operand (input) vectors. You know that the base vectors $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$, and $\mathbf{k}$ are all orthogonal, thus if your two input vectors lie on the $(x, y)$ plane (i.e. only $\mathbf{i}$ and $\mathbf{j}$ components), you know that any orthogonal vector must have only a component in the $z$ direction (multiple of $\mathbf{k}$).	-2
43	11	You can visualise it by thinking about it in infinitesimals. The more $9's$ you have on the end of $0.999$, the closer you get to $1$. When you add an infinite number of $9's$ to the decimal expansion, you are infinitely close to $1$ (or an infinitesimal distance away).And this isn't a rigorous proof, just an aid to visualisation of the result.	15
44	11	What I really don't like about all the above answers, is the underlying assumption that $1/3=0.3333\ldots$ How do you know that? It seems to me like assuming the something which is already known.A proof I really like is:$$\begin{align}    0.9999\ldots × 10 &= 9.9999\ldots\\    0.9999\ldots × (9+1) &= 9.9999\ldots\\\text{by distribution rule: }\Space{15ex}{0ex}{0ex} \\    0.9999\ldots × 9 + 0.9999\ldots × 1 &= 9.9999\ldots\\    0.9999\ldots × 9 &= 9.9999\dots-0.9999\ldots\\    0.9999\ldots × 9 &= 9\\    0.9999\ldots &= 1\end{align}$$The only things I need to assume is, that $9.999\ldots - 0.999\ldots = 9$ and that $0.999\ldots × 10 = 9.999\ldots$ These seems to me intuitive enough to take for granted.The proof is from an old high school level math book of the Open University in Israel.	147
47	29	Google's calculator is very powerful: http://www.googleguide.com/help/calculator.html and your use history will be stored in your browser history.	8
48	20	You might as well start at the 'lowest':Integers are all the whole numbers,Natural numbers (N) are the set of positive integers, {1, 2, ...} (0 optional),Rational numbers (Q) are any number that can be represented a/b with a and b being Integers (|b| < 0.Real numbers are all the Rational numbers and all the others.Cardinality is the number of elements in a set.An Ordinal is a well ordered set.	1
49	11	What does it mean when you refer to $.99999\ldots$?  Symbols don't mean anything in particular until you've defined what you mean by them.In this case the definition is that you're taking the limit of $.9$, $.99$, $.999$, $.9999$, etc.  What does it mean to say that limit is $1$?  Well, it means that no matter how small a number $x$ you pick, I can show you a point in that sequence such that all further numbers in the sequence are within distance $x$ of $1$.  But certainly whatever number you chose your number is bigger than $10^{-k}$ for some $k$.  So I can just pick my point to be the $k$th spot in the sequence.A more intuitive way of explaining the above argument is that the reason $.99999\ldots = 1$ is that their difference is zero.  So let's subtract $1.0000\ldots -.99999\ldots = .00000\ldots = 0$.  That is, $1.0 -.9 = .1$$1.00-.99 = .01$$1.000-.999=.001$, $\ldots$$1.000\ldots -.99999\ldots = .000\ldots = 0$	306
51	The cow in the field problem (intersecting circular areas)	What length of rope should be used to tie a cow to an exterior fence post of a circular field so that the cow can only graze half of the grass within that field?updated: To be clear: the cow should be tied to a post on the exterior of the field, not a post at the center of the field. 	14
52	1	  A countably infinite set is a set for which you can list the elements a1,a2,a3,...For example, the set of all integers is countably infinite since I can list its elements as follows 0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,... So is the set of rational numbers, but this is more difficult to see. Let's start with the positive rationals. Can you see the pattern in this listing?1/1,1/2,2/1,1/3,2/2,3/1,1/4,2/3,3/2,4/1,1/5,2/4,...(Hint: Add the numerator and denominator to see a different pattern.) This listing has lots of repeats, e.g. 1/1, 2/2 and 1/2, 2/4. That's ok since I can condense the listing by skipping over any repeats.1/1,1/2,2/1,1/3,3/1,1/4,2/3,3/2,4/1,1/5,...Let's write qn for the n-th element of this list. Then 0,q1,-q1,q2,-q2,q3,-q3,... is a listing of all rational numbers.  A countable set is a set which is either finite or countably infinite; an uncountable set is a set which is not countable.Thus, an uncountable set is an infinite set which has no listing of all of its elements (as in the definition of countably infinite set).An example of an uncountable set is the set of all real numbers. To see this, you can use the diagonal method. Ask another question to see how this works...	9
53	22	Assuming you know the definition of orthogonal as "a is orthogonal to b iff $a\cdot b=0$ then we could calculate $(a \times b)\cdot a = a_1(a_2b_3-a_3b_2)-a_2(a_1b_3-a_3b_1)-a_3(a_1b_2-a_2b_1)=0$ and  $(a \times b)\cdot b-0$, so the cross product is orthogonal to both. As Nold mentioned, if the two vectors a and b lie in the x,y plane, then the orthogonal vectors must be purely in the z direction.	4
54	20	Real numbersReal numbers are any numbers you can locate (even approximately) on an infinite number line.  This is a theoretical number line with infinite "resolution" that extends infinitely in both positive and negative directions.One neat property about real numbers is that they are orderable -- that is, given any two real numbers, you can tell which one is "higher" and which one is "lower" than the other.Real numbers are closed under multiplication, addition, and subtraction.  That is, if you perform any of these operations on two real numbers, their result will always be real as well.  They are almost closed under division, except for the whole divide-by-zero issue.Not real numbers:infinitythe square root of -11/0DecimalsThere isn't a rigorous definition of "decimals", because depending on where you use it, you'll get different definitions.In the elementary sense, it means any number that has a "decimal part"; or a part after the radix (decimal point, etc.).In a more advance sense, it means any number written in Base 10.Natural numbersNatural numbers are often also called "counting numbers", because they are the numbers you count with.  (0,) 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.There is some disagreement in the mathematics community over whether or not 0 is a natural number.CardinalsIn linguistics, this means the natural "numbers" themselves (1, 2, 3, etc.)  But you probably don't want to know about linguistics.In Set Theory, two sets have the same cardinality if each element could be paired up with an element of the other set.{1,2,3} and {4,5,6} share the same cardinality because you can pair up 1&4, 2&5, 3&6.OrdinalsIn linguistics, this means 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.  But you probably don't want to know about linguistics.In Set Theory, an ordinal is a well-ordered set.	6
55	29	Essentially the most helpful is WolframAlpha, as Ami said, you can use your browser history here too.WolframAlpha can carry out complex equations can comparisons much like a TI Calculator. Additionally they have some areas where you can see the simplification of an equation paired with charts and graphs where possible.	27
57	How do the Properties of Relations work?	This is simply not clicking for me. I'm currently learning math during the summer vacation and I'm on the chapter for relations and functions.There are five properties for a relation:Reflexive - $R \rightarrow  R$Symmetrical - $R \rightarrow S$ ; $S \rightarrow  R$Antisymmetrical - $R \rightarrow S$ && ($R \rightarrow  R$|| $S \rightarrow  S$)Asymmetrical -$R \rightarrow S$ && !($R \rightarrow  R$|| $S \rightarrow  S$)Transitive - if $R \rightarrow S$ && $S \rightarrow T$, then $R \rightarrow T$If that's not what you call the properties in English, then please let me know- I have to study it in German, unfortunately, and these are my rough translations.Continuing on, I just don't know what to do with this information practically. The examples of the book are horrible:1) "Is the same age as" is apparently reflexive, symmetrical and transitive. 2) "Is related to" is also apparently reflexive, symmetrical and transitive.3) "Is older than" is asymmetric, antisymmetric and transitive.There are more useless examples like this. I have no idea how it comes to these conclusions because we're talking about a literal statement. I was hoping perhaps for some real mathematical examples, but the book falls short on those.I would greatly appreciate it if somebody could explain the above example and perhaps give me a better use for Relations other than... that. Also, how can a relation be a- and antisymmetrical at the same time? Don't they cancel each other out? 	10
58	Real life usage of Benford's Law	I recently discovered Benford's Law. I find it very fascinating. I'm wondering what are some of the real life uses of Benford's law. Specific examples would be great.	40
59	Calculating an Angle from $2$ points in space	Given two points around an origin $(0,0)$ in $2D$ space, how would you calculate an angle from $p_1$ to $p_2$?How would this change in $3D$ space?	7
60	11	Suppose this was not the case, i.e. $0.9999... \neq 1$. Then $0.9999... < 1$ (I hope we agree on that). But between two distinct real numbers, there's always another one (say $x$) in between, hence $0.9999... < x < 1$.The decimal representation of $x$ must have a digit somewhere that is not $9$ (otherwise $x = 0.9999...$). But that means it's actually smaller, $x < 0.9999...$, contradicting the definition of $x$.Thus, the assumption that there's a number between $0.9999...$ and $1$ is false, hence they're equal.	225
62	51	So, the area of the field is $\pi r^2$ and you want the cow to be able to graze an area equal to half of that.All you need to do is set up the equation ($r_1$ is the radius of the field, $r_2$ is the length of the rope desired):$$\frac{(\pi r_1^2)}{2} = \pi r_2^2$$You can then simplify it down:$$\frac{r_1^2 }{2} =r_2^2$$and then taking roots:$$r_2 =\frac{ r_1 }{\sqrt{2}}$$So you need a rope that is equal to the radius divided by the square root of $2$, and the post can be no closer than this distance to the edge of the field.	2
63	58	I've heard of it being as a rough check to see if accounting numbers were being made up	2
64	51	Let the total area of the field = $A$.We know $A = \pi R^2$ where $R$ = the radius of the field.We want the cow to be able to graze half the area, so we solve for a length of rope $r$ such that $\pi r^2 = A / 2$.This gives: $\pi r^2 = \pi R^2 / 2$, hence $r = R / \sqrt(2)$.In words, the length of the cow's rope should be the radius of the field divided by sqrt(2).	2
65	59	Assuming this is relative to the origin (as John pointed out): Given two position vectors $\vec p_1$ and $\vec p_2$, their dot product is:$$\vec p_1\cdot \vec p_2 = |\vec p_1| \cdot |\vec p_2| \cdot \cos \theta$$Solving for $\theta$, we get:$$\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{\vec p_1 \cdot \vec p_2}{|\vec p_1| \cdot |\vec p_2|}\right)$$In a 2D space this equals:$$v = \arccos\left(\frac{x_1x_2 + y_1y_2}{\sqrt{(x_1^2+y_1^2) \cdot (x_2^2+y_2^2)}}\right)$$And extended for 3D space:$$v = \arccos\left(\frac{x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 + z_1z_2}{\sqrt{(x_1^2+y_1^2+z_1^2) \cdot (x_2^2+y_2^2+z_2^2)}}\right)$$	7
66	57	There are several important kinds of relations, each of which satisfy a different collection of properties:Equivalence relations:These are reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  Essentially they're relations that "behave like equality."  The most important elementary one is "equivalence modulo m," where say 1 = 6 = 11 modulo 5.Partial orderings:These are reflexive, transitive, and (anti-symmetric or maybe asymmetric, I'm having trouble parsing your logical statements).  Essentially they're relations that "behave like less than or equal to."  An important elementary example is "divides" where we say a|b if the ratio b/a is an integer.  Note that 2|6 but 6 does not divide 2.  However if 2|4 and 4|8 certainly 2|8.	3
67	What is an elliptic curve, and how are they used in cryptography?	I hear a lot about Elliptic Curve Cryptography these days, but I'm still not quite sure what they are or how they relate to crypto...	33
68	59	I will assume that you mean the angle of the line from p1 to p2 with respect to the x-axisThis is the best I can do given the information you have provided.In any case, the official mathsy way would be to find the dot product between the two, and divide by the magnitude of p1-p2 and take the arccossine.v = (normalized vector from p1 to p2)theta = arccos( v * <1,0> )    (dot product)You can normalize a vector by dividing every term by the magnitude (length) of the entire vector.For 3D, the same thing applies:theta = arccos( v * <1,0,0> )   (dot product)You could also possibly mean the angle between the line from the origin to p1 and the line from the origin to p2.You can do this with dot products, as well; but both vectors must be normalized.theta = arccos( a * b ) (dot product)where a is the normalized vector from the origin to p1 and b is the normalized vector from the origin to p2.	1
69	1	You can see that there are infinitely many natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., and infinitely many real numbers, such as 0, 1, pi, etc. But are these two infinities the same?Well, suppose you have two sets of objects, e.g. people and horses, and you want to know if the number of objects in one set is the same as in the other. The simplest way is to find a way of corresponding the objects one-to-one. For instance, if you see a parade of people riding horses, you will know that there are as many people as there are horses, because there is such a one-to-one correspondence.We say that an set with infinitely many things is "countable," if we can find a one-to-one correspondence between the things in this set and the natural numbers.E.g., the integers are countable: 1 <-> 0, 2 <-> -1, 3 <-> 1, 4 <-> -2, 5 <-> 2, etc, gives such a correspondence.However, the set of real numbers is NOT countable! This was proven for the first time by Georg Cantor. Here is a proof using the so-called diagonal argument.	5

73	56	An inner product space is a vector space for which the inner product is defined. The inner product is also known as the 'dot product' for 2D or 3D Euclidean space. An arbitrary number of inner products can be defined according to three rules, though most are a lot less intuitive/practical than the Euclidean (dot) product.Side note:It may seem slightly esoteric, but as a physicist the obvious application of inner product spaces are Hilbert spaces used in quantum mechanics. The inner product of an eigenfunction with a wavefunction in Hilbert space gives the corresponding eigenvalue.	8

76	57	Asymmetric means simply "not symmetric". So in the binary case, it is NOT the case that if a is related to b, b is related to a.Antisymmetric means that if a is related to b, and b is related to a, a = b.To explain your third example:"is older than" is asymmetric because if Alice is older than Bob, Bob is NOT older than Alice. "is older than" is antisymmetric since if Alice is older than Bob, and Bob is older than Alice, Alice must be Bob because someone must be older (and if this is not the case, Alice simply has two names..). "is older than" is transitive since if Alice is older than Bob, and Bob is older than Charlie, Alice is also older than Charlie.So asymmetric and antisymmetric don't cancel out because the first means it's sort of a one-way relation, whereas the second means, loosely, that if it you reverse the operands and both statements are true, the operands must be the same.	2
77	Understanding Dot and Cross Product	What purposes do the Dot and Cross products serve? Do you have any clear examples of when you would use them?	34
78	71	I believe they are used in quantum physics as well, because rotation with quaternions models Spinors extremely well (due to the lovely property that you need to rotate a point in quaternionic space around 2 full revolutions to get back to your 'original', which is exactly what happens with spin-1/2 particles).They are also, as you said, used in computer graphics a lot for several reasons:they are much more space efficient to store than rotation matrices (4 floats rather than 16)They are much easier to interpolate than euler angle rotations (spherical interpolation or normalised liner interpolation)They avoid gimbal lockIt's much cooler to say that your rotation is described as 'a great circle on the surface of a unit 4 dimensional hypersphere' :)I think there are other uses, but a lot of them have been superseded by more general Vectors.	16
79	20	The natural numbers can be defined by Peano's Axioms (sometimes called the Peano Postulates):Zero is a number.If n is a number, the successor of n is a number.zero is not the successor of a number.Two numbers of which the successors are equal are themselves equal.(induction axiom.) If a set S of numbers contains zero and also the successor of every number in S, then every number is in S.(This definition includes 0 in the natural numbers; altering rules 1, 3, and 5 to refer to one instead of zero excludes 0 from the natural numbers.  Whether or not 0 is a natural number varies in various texts.)The whole numbers are the natural numbers with the additive identity element called 0.The integers are the whole numbers and their additive inverses.The rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of an integer to a non-zero integer.The real numbers are the set of numbers that are limits of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.The irrational numbers are the real numbers that are not rational numbers.The complex numbers are the numbers that can be expressed as a + b * i where a and b are real numbers and i behaves like a real number under addition/multiplication/distribution/etc., with the added rule that i2 = -1.The imaginary numbers are sometimes defined to be the "pure imaginary" numbers--complex numbers for which the "real part" a = 0, sometimes with the added restriction that b is not zero--and are sometimes defined to be the non-real complex numbers.The algebraic numbers are numbers that are solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients.The transcendental numbers are complex numbers (sometimes limited to real numbers) that are not algebraic.	21
80	75	They should feel similar! In fact, every ring is a group, and every field is a ring. A ring is a group with an additional operation, where the second operation is associative and the distributive properties make the two operations "compatible". A field is a ring such that the second operation also satisfies all the group properties (after throwing out the additive identity); i.e. it has multiplicative inverses, multiplicative identity, and is commutative.	41

83	What are some good ways to get children excited about math?	I'm talking in the range of 10-12 years old, but this question isn't limited to only that range.Do you have any advice on cool things to show kids that might spark their interest in spending more time with math? The difficulty for some to learn math can be pretty overwhelming. Do you have any teaching techniques that you find valuable?	61
84	77	The dot product can be used to find the length of a vector or the angle between two vectors.The cross product is used to find a vector which is perpendicular to the plane spanned by two vectors.	7
85	77	When you deal with vectors, sometimes you say to yourself, "Darn I wish there was a function that..."was zero when two vectors are perpendicular, letting me test perpendicularness."Dot Productwould let me find the angle between two vectors."Dot Product (actually gives the cosine of the angle between two normalized vectors)would let me 'project' one vector onto another, or give the length of one vector in the direction of another."Dot Productcould tell me how much force is actually helping the object move, when pushing at an angle."Dot Productcould tell me how much a vector field is 'spreading out'."Dot Productcould give me a vector that is perpendicular to two other vectors."Cross Productcould tell me how much torque a force was applying to a rotating system."Cross Productcould tell me how much this vector field is 'curling' up."Cross ProductThere are actually a lot more uses, but the more I study vectors, the more and more I run into a situation where I need a function to do exactly something, and then realize that the cross/dot products already did exactly what I needed!	52
86	56	As for the utility of inner product spaces: They're vector spaces where notions like the length of a vector and the angle between two vectors are available. In this way, they generalize $\mathbb R^n$ but preserve some of its additional structure that comes on top of it being a vector space. Familiar friends like Cauchy-Schwarz, the parallelogram rule, and orthogonality all work in inner product spaces.(Note that there is a more general class of spaces, normed spaces, where notions of length make sense always, but an inner product cannot necessarily be defined.)The dot product is the standard inner product on $\mathbb R^n$. In general, any symmetric, positive definite matrix will give you an inner product on $\mathbb C^n$. And you can have inner products on infinite dimensional vector spaces, like $$ \langle \, f, \, g \, \rangle = \int_a^b \ f(x)\overline{g(x)} \, dx$$for $f, g$ square-integrable functions on $[a,b]$.This becomes useful, for example, in applications like Fourier series where you want a basis of orthonormal functions for some function space (it's not just the trigonometric functions that work).	25
87	11	$$x=0.999...$$$$10x=9.999...$$$$10x-x=9.999...-0.999...$$$$9x=9$$$$x=1$$thus, $0.999...=1$	53
88	83	Graph theory! It's essentially connecting the dots, but with theorems working wonders behind the scenes for when they're old enough. Simple exercises like asking how many colors you need to color the faces or vertices of a graph are often fun (so I hear). (Also, most people won't believe the 4-color theorem.)	31
89	22	Note that if you replace $i$, $j$, and $k$ with $m$, $n$, and $p$, the determinant becomes the dot-product of the vector $(m, n, p)$ with the cross-product of the two original vectors.  If $(m, n, p) = (a, b, c)$ or $(m, n, p) = (d, e, f)$, the determinant is zero (any matrix with two identical rows has determinant zero), so the dot product of $(a, b, c)$ or $(d, e, f)$ with the cross-product is zero.  Hence, $(a, b, c)$ and $(d, e, f)$ are orthogonal to their cross-product.	2
91	75	You're right to think that the definitions are very similar. The main difference between groups and rings is that rings have two binary operations (usually called addition and multiplication) instead of just one binary operation. If you forget about multiplication, then a ring becomes a group with respect to addition (the identity is 0 and inverses are negatives). This group is always commutative!If you forget about addition, then a ring does not become a group with respect to multiplication. The binary operation of multiplication is associative and it does have an identity 1, but some elements like 0 do not have inverses. (This structure is called a monoid.)A commutative ring is a field when all nonzero elements have multiplicative inverses. In this case, if you forget about addition and remove 0, the remaining elements do form a group under multiplication. This group is again commutative.A division ring is a (not necessarily commutative) ring in which all nonzero elements have multiplicative inverses. Again, if you forget about addition and remove 0, the remaining elements do form a group under multiplication. This group is not necessarily commutative. An example of a division ring which is not a field are the quaternions.	24

100	83	If they're fairly mathematically inclined anyway, then try to get them solving interesting problems with an obvious mathematical content, if they're less mathematically inclined try to find problems where the usage of maths isn't as explicit.Problems with a very mathematical bent can be found at places like NRich, they update their problems monthly, the Stage 2 and 3 problems cover that age range. Other sources for problems could be video games (resource management based games require mathematical thinking), code breaking or programming a game (a simple driving game in Flash requires a lot of maths based problem solving).If they've convinced themselves that they can't do Maths then you basically need to smuggle the maths into your chosen activity without them realising that they're doing maths to solve the problem.	6
101	Faulty logic when summing large integers?	This  is in relation to the Euler Problem $13$ from http://www.ProjectEuler.net.Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred $50$-digit numbers.$37107287533902102798797998220837590246510135740250$Now, this was my thinking:I can freely discard the last fourty digits and leave the last ten.$0135740250$And then simply sum those. This would be large enough to be stored in a $64$-bit data-type and a lot easier to compute. However, my answer isn't being accepted, so I'm forced to question my logic.However, I don't see a problem. The last fourty digits will never make a difference because they are at least a magnitude of $10$ larger than the preceding values and therefore never carry backwards into smaller areas. Is this not correct?	3
102	83	This really depend on how smart the kid is.I lean toward discrete math, elementary number theory related topics when talking to non-math people about math. They requires little background knowledge. There are some fun problems in discrete math, especially combinatorics.Simple probability is also nice. So are logic problem.Both topics can be used to formulate some simple puzzles.A simple number theory puzzleHow many zeros are there in 20!I assume a bright 10 year old can solve it.	3
103	71	One place they are frequently used is in computer games when you want to smoothly transition from one rotation to another. An artist might have said "at this time I want the head oriented like this and at that time I want it like this". The computer needs to work out what happens in-between these poses. It's quite easy to find in-between poses using quaternions. If the two poses are reasonably similar, then you can get a half-way orientation simply by taking the average of the quaternions. You can find out more here.	9
104	101	First you are doing it in the wrong end, second, the statement in general is still not correct.for example:99999999991000000001Say if you want the first 2 digits,you will get 10 if you discard the last 2 digit and do the sum.The right answer is 11	3
105	101	If you were supposed to find the last ten digits, you could just ignore the first 40 digits of each number. However you're supposed to find the first ten digits, so that doesn't work. And you can't just ignore the last digits of each number either because those can carry over.	7
106	98	Since you're asking for a reference, perhaps this will do?Wolfram Mathworld says the problem was listed by Rado in 1925. The reference is on the problem description page, here.	5
107	Paradox: increasing sequence that goes to $0$?	It is $10$ o'clock, and I have a box.  Inside the box is a ball marked $1$.    At $10$:$30$, I will remove the ball marked $1$, and add two balls, labeled $2$ and $3$.At $10$:$45$, I will remove the balls labeled $2$ and $3$, and add $4$ balls, marked $4$, $5$, $6$, and $7$.$7.5$ minutes before $11$, I will remove the balls labeled $4$, $5$, and $6$, and add $8$ balls, labeled $8$, $9$, $10$, $11$, $12$, $13$, $14$, and $15$.This pattern continues. Each time I reach the halfway point between my previous action and $11$ o'clock, I add some balls, and remove some other balls. Each time I remove one more ball than I removed last time, but add twice as many balls as I added last time.  The result is that as it gets closer and closer to $11$, the number of balls in the box continues to increase. Yet every ball that I put in was eventually removed. So just how many balls will be in the box when the clock strikes $11$?$0$, or infinitely many?What's going on here? 	43
108	71	You can view a real-world example of quaternions in computer graphics with the open source program known as NASA WorldWind (http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/).It uses a Quaternion object to represent rotation of various geometries.

109	51	The field is the smaller/left circle, centered at A.  The cow is tied to the post at E.  The larger/right circle is the grazing radius.  Let the radius of the field be R and the length of the rope be L.The grazable area is the union of a segment of the circular field and a segment of the circle defined by the rope length.  (A segment of a circle is a sector of a circle less the triangle defined by the center of the circle and the endpoints of the arc.)  The area of a segment of a circle of radius $R$ with central angle $t$ is $\frac{1}{2}R^2(t-\sin(t))$, where $t$ is measured in radians.In order to express the grazable area in terms of $R$ and one angle, we consider the angles ∠CED and ∠CAD (which define the segments of the circles; call these α and β for convenience) and the triangle CEF. Let $\theta$ be ∠EFC. $2\theta$ is an inscribed angle for the central angle $\beta$ over the same arc, making $\beta = 4\theta$. The sum of angles in triangle CEF is $\theta + \pi/2 +\alpha/2=\pi$ or $\alpha =\pi-2\theta$.The grazable area is $\frac{1}{2}L^2(\alpha-\sin\alpha)+\frac{1}{2}R^2(\beta-\sin\beta)=R^2(\frac{1}{2}(L/R)^2((\pi-2\theta)-\sin(\pi-2\theta))+\frac{1}{2}(4\theta-\sin(4\theta)))$, where $a = CE = L/R=2\sin(\theta)$.  We want that to be equal to half the area of the field, $\frac{1}{2}\pi R^2$.That is, the equality of areas is $$R^2(2(\sin(\theta))^2((\pi-2\theta)-\sin(\pi-2\theta))+\frac{1}{2}(4\theta-\sin(4\theta)))=R^2\frac{\pi}{2}$$Simplifying: $$R^2(\pi+(2\theta-\pi)\cos(2\theta)-\sin(2\theta)=\frac{\pi}{2})$$(The grazable area seems to be $\pi+\alpha\cos\alpha-\sin\alpha$; can this be seen easily?)The desired equality of areas is obtained for $\theta = \text{ca. } 0.618$ or  $L=\text{ca. }1.159 R$ .	14
110	11	One argument against this is that 0.99999999... is "somewhat" less than 1. How much exactly?      1 - 0.999999... = ε              (0)If the above is true, the following also must be true:9 × (1 - 0.999999...) = ε × 9Let's calculate:0.999... ×9        =───────────8.1  81   81     .      .       .───────────8.999...Thus:     9 - 8.999999... = 9ε              (1)But:         8.999999... = 8 + 0.99999...

112	What are gradients and how would I use them?	I keep seeing this symbol $\nabla$ around and I know enough to understand that it represents the term "gradient." But what is a gradient? When would I want to use one mathematically?	7
113	What are some classic fallacious proofs?	If you know it, also try to include the precise reason why the proof is fallacious. To start this off, let me post the one that most people know already: Let $a = b$. Then $a^2 = ab$ $a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2$ Factor to $(a-b)(a+b) = b(a-b)$ Then divide out $(a-b)$ to get $a+b = b$ Since $a = b$, then $b+b = b$ Therefore $2b = b$ Reduce to $2 = 1$As -gorzny pointed out, in this case, line 5 is wrong since $a = b$ implies $a-b = 0$, and so you can't divide out $(a-b)$.	17
114	107	During one math class I had the same problem. the professor told us the answer can be a arbitrary integer, depend on how you remove the balls.Since you said every ball you put in was eventually removed, I will make it simple and assume you first number the balls to natural numbers, and then add and remove the balls with the smallest numbers first.In this case, the bin will be empty--every ball put in have been removed.If you define the sequence in the way such that a_n = amount of balls when you do the nth move, then this sequence never get to zero, because there is no n correspond to 11 o'clock.The increasing sequence doesn't define how many balls in the bin at 11. Therefore there is no paradox.	2
115	112	The ∇ (pronounced "del") is an operator, more technically.  In 3D, it (more or less) means the vector< df/dx, df/dy, df/dz >So, if f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^3*z + sin(z), ∇f = < 2x, 3y^2*z, y^3 + cos(z) >It's actually a bit more subtle than that; technically it means< d/dx, d/dy, d/dz >And when you do ∇f, it's sort of like a "multiplication" of ∇ and f;< d/dx, d/dy, d/dz > f = < d/dx f, d/dy f, d/dz f >Only, not multiplication, but operation.There are some neat properties about the del operator.  Here are a couple:The most famous is that ∇f yields the gradient of f.  That is, at any point (x,y,z), ∇f(x,y,z) is the vector pointing in the direction where it is most increasing.  The magnitude of it is the magnitude of the increase.This is easier to understand with, say, a 2D f(x,y).  If f(x,y) represents the height of a point at (x,y), then ∇f(x,y) represents the steepest incline from that point.  Or rather, if you placed a ball on that point, it would start rolling in the opposite direction of the gradient vector.Normally, for multi-dimensional functions, it is easiest to find the derivative along an axis (x, y, z, etc.).  With ∇, you can find the derivative along any arbitrary direction by using ∇f * u, where * is the dot product and u is the unit vector along the direction you are calculating.∇ is also used to calculate divergence (amount that vectors are "spreading out") and curl (amount that vectors are "curling up") of a vector field.Divergence is ∇ * f (dot product), and curl is ∇ x f (cross product)They aren't truly "products" in the sense.  Rather, when you are calculating divergence and curl and you must do d/dx * (something), you are actually doing d/dx (something) or d(something)/dx.	9

124	123	If you take a rope, fix the two ends, and let it hang under the force of gravity, it will naturally form a hyperbolic cosine curve.	35
125	118	There came a time in mathematics when people encountered situations where they had to deal with really, really, really small things.Not just small like 0.01; but small as in infinitesimally small.  Think of "the smallest positive number that is still greater than zero" and you'll realize what sort of problems mathematicians began encountering.Soon, this problem became more than just theoretical or abstract.  It became very, very real.For example, velocity.  We know that average velocity is the change in position per change in time (i.e., 5 miles per hour).  But what about velocity at a point in time?  What does it mean to be going 5 mph at this moment?One solution someone came up with was to say "it's the change in position divided by the change in time, where the change in time is an infinitesimally small amount of time".  But how would you handle/calculate that?Another problem came about trying to find the area under a curve.  The current accepted solution was to divide the curve into rectangles, and add together the area of the rectangles.  However, in order to find the exact area under the curve, you'd need to divide it into rectangles that were infinitesimally tiny, and, therefore, add up an infinite amount of tiny rectangles -- to something that was finite (area).Calculus came about as the system of math dedicated to studying these infinitesimally small changes.  In fact, I do believe some people describe calculus as "the study of continuous changes".	21
126	123	An equation for a catenary curve can be given in terms of hyperbolic cosine.  Catenary curves appear in many places, such as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, MO.	4
127	118	Calculus is a field which deals with two seemingly unrelated things.(1) the area beneath a graph and the x-axis.(2) the slope (or gradient) of a curve at different points.Part (1) is also called 'integration' and 'anti-differentiation', and part (2) is called 'differentiation'.	4
128	How do you prove that $p(n \xi)$ for $\xi$ irrational and $p$ a polynomial is uniformly distributed modulo 1?	The Weyl equidistribution theorem states that the sequence of fractional parts ${n \xi}$, $n = 0, 1, 2, \dots$ is uniformly distributed for $\xi$ irrational. This can be proved using a bit of ergodic theory, specifically the fact that an irrational rotation is uniquely ergodic with respect to Lebesgue measure. It can also be proved by simply playing with trigonometric polynomials (i.e., polynomials in $e^{2\pi i k x}$ for $k$ an integer) and using the fact they are dense in the space of all continuous functions with period 1.  In particular, one shows that if $f(x)$ is a continuous function with period 1, then for any $t$,  $\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \lim \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(t+i \xi)$. One shows this by checking this (directly) for trigonometric polynomials via the geometric series.  This is a very elementary and nice proof.The general form of Weyl's theorem states that if $p$ is a monic integer-valued polynomial, then the sequence ${p(n \xi)}$ for $\xi$ irrational is uniformly distributed modulo 1.  I believe this can be proved using extensions of these ergodic theory techniques -- it's an exercise in Katok and Hasselblatt.  I'd like to see an elementary proof.Can the general form of Weyl's theorem be proved using the same elementary techniques as in the basic version?	12
129	118	To be very brief and succinct:  Calculus is the study of how quantities changeSlightly more technically, it a subject based on infinitesimals.It may be pointing out the obvious, but the Wikipedia article does actually provide a pretty decent beginners introduction to the subject. You'll generally want to start with differential calculus and move on quickly to integral calculus, followed by linking up the two (fundamental theorem of calculus) and moving on from there.	2

132	83	I recently taught a once-a-week geometry class to grades 7-10 where we did some graph theory, some surfaces, some spherical geometry, a lot of complex numbers, and basic ideas of homeomorphism and homotopy. Most couldn't work with complex numbers at the beginning: showing their use in proofs of analytic geometry results had the benefit of not boring the kids who had already seen and worked with complex numbers, and giving the kids who hadn't a reason to learn the technicalities (getting under the hood of these pretty pictures).Euler's formula and the relation of planar graphs to polyhedra showed them the basics of a connection between geometric and algebraic intuition, outside the coordinate geometry many were used to, and got them thinking about ways to define familiar things mathematically (space), and what we can learn about familiar things through mathematics (surprising things like orientability through the Möbius strip, or sphere eversion).In general I've found geometry to be a very good place to start with people with a professed fear or disinterest in mathematics. For me, it's the quickest way to show the distance between what mathematicians play with when they're doing math and what was taught in high school, with the two column proof nonsense and the treatment of math as a branch of formal logic.Of course, I suspect that I find this path the easiest because it is one of the ones I am most excited about in mathematics, and I further imagine that in many cases, the best thing to use to get people excited about math is something you yourself are really excited about, as long as you can think to translate it well.	22
133	3	I listen to Math Mutation Podcast. The topics are interesting and understandable by a layman.	3
134	57	I'd like to change the notation of your definitions, since $R$, $S$ and $T$ would usually be used to stand for the relations themselves (and $x, y$ and $z$ would be more commonly chosen for the objects that might bear the relation to each other).Reflexive - For all $x: xRx$Example reflexive relation: $xRy$ stands for '$x$ is a factor of $y$' (in the set of natural numbers)Symmetric - For all $x,y$: if $xRy$ then $yRx$Example symmetric relation: $xRy$ stands for '$x$ and $y$ are $2$ metres apart' (in the set of all people in a particular room)Antisymmetric - For all $x,y$: if $xRy$ and $yRx$ then $x = y$Example antisymmetric relation: $xRy$ stands for '$x$ is a factor of $y$' (in the set of natural numbers)Asymmetric - For all $x,y$: if $xRy$ then not $yRx$Example asymmetric relation: $xRy$ stands for '$x$ is taller than $y$' (in the set of all people)Transitive - For all $x,y,z$: if $xRy$ and $yRz$ then $xRz$Example transitive relation: $xRy$ stands for '$x$ is taller than $y$' (in the set of all people)	7
135	Why is $x^0 = 1$ except when $x = 0$?	Why is any number (other than zero) to the power of zero equal to one? Please include in your answer an explanation of why $0^0$ should be undefined.	29
136	Why are the differences between consecutive squares equal to the sequence of odd numbers?	I was playing around with the squares and saw an interesting pattern in their differences.$0^2 = 0$      + 1$1^2 = 1$      + 3$2^2 = 4$      + 5$3^2 = 9$      + 7$4^2 = 16$      + 9$5^2 = 25$      + 11$6^2 = 36$      etc.(Also, in a very related question, which major Math Research Journal should I contact to publish my groundbreaking find in?)	12
137	67	The technical definition is a nonsingular projective curve of genus 1, which is an abelian variety under the group law: basially, this means that you   draw the line through two points on the curve -- which can be embedded in the projective plane -- and find where that line intersects the curve again (and call that the negative of the sum).  We can always put elliptic curves in the (projectivization of the) form $y^2 = x^3 - Ax + B$.  So, the meaning of "abelian variety" is that you can add points on the elliptic curve, which is really useful; there isn't a way to do this for most objects in algebraic geometry.  Then one can study things like the torsion points on an elliptic curve, with respect to this abelian group structure: it's a theorem that there are $m^2$ torsion points of order $m$ for instance, if you 're working in an algebraically closed field. In fact, one way to think of this is that an elliptic curve is really--algebraically and topologically--a torus if you are working over the complex numbers, and the torsion points in the torus are easily determined.  (Namely, a torus is algebraically the product of two copies of the unit circle.)This also yields the theorem about torsion points for algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero via the "Lefschetz principle."  (For characteristic p, you need a different argument.) Other things one can consider include the group of points with coordinates in, say, the rational numbers (assuming the curve is defined by rational coefficients). One of the central theorems is that this group is finitely generated.  The point is that the geometry of the elliptic curve leads to a rich algebraic structure.That's a bit about elliptic curves; I know nothing about cryptography and can't comment on that.	12
138	135	For non-zero bases and exponents, the relation $ x^a x^b = x^{a+b} $ holds. For this to make sense with an exponent of $ 0 $, $ x^0 $ needs to equal one. This gives you: $ x^a \cdot 1 = x^a\cdot x^0 = x^{a+0} = x^a $When the base is also zero, it's not possible to define a value for $0^0$ because there is no value that is consistent with all the necessary constraints. For example, $0^x = 0$ and $x^0 = 1$ for all positive $x$, and $0^0$ can't be consistent with both of these.Another way to see that $0^0$ can't have a reasonable definition is to look at the graph of $f(x,y) = x^y$ which is discontinuous around $(0,0)$. No chosen value for $0^0$ will avoid this discontinuity.	29
139	How do I cut a square in half?	I have a square that's $10\mathrm{m} \times 10\mathrm{m}$. I want to cut it in half so that I have a square with half the area. But if I cut it from top to bottom or left to right, I don't get a square, I get a rectangle!  I know the area of the small square is supposed to be $50\mathrm{m}^{2}$, so I can use my calculator to find out how long a side should be: it's $7.07106781\mathrm{m}$. But my teacher said I should be able to do this without a calculator. How am I supposed to get that number by hand?	13
140	135	$$0^x = 0, \quad x^0=1$$both are true when $x>0$. What happens when $x=0$? It is undefined because there is no way to chose one definition over the other.Some people define $0^0 = 1$ in their books, like Knuth, because $0^x$ is less 'useful' than $x^0$.	12
141	135	This is a question of definition, the question is "why does it make sense to define $x^0=1$ except when $x=0$?" or "How is this definition better than other definitions?"The answer is that $x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}$ is an excellent formula that makes a lot of sense (multiplying $a$ times and then multiplying $b$ times is the same as multiplying $a+b$ times) and which you can prove for $a$ and $b$ positive integers.  So any sensible definition of $x^a$ for numbers $a$ which aren't positive integers should still satisfy this identity.  In particular, $x^0 \cdot x^b = x^{0+b} = x^b$; now if $x$ is not zero then you can cancel $x^b$ from both sides and get that $x^0 = 1$.  But if $x=0$ then $x^b$ is zero and so this argument doesn't tell you anything about what you should define $x^0$ to be.A similar argument should convince you that when $x$ is not zero then $x^{-a}$ should be defined as $1/x^a$.An argument using the related identity $(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$ should convince you that $x^{1/n}$ is taking the $n$th root.	24
142	123	Apart from occuring naturally in the form of the catenary mentioned, hyperbolic trig functions are also fundamentally important in calculus. I hope you'll agree that calculus has many, many real world applications!	2
143	136	A nice thing to notice.It's basically because$(n + 1) ^ 2 - n ^ 2 = 2n + 1$	22
144	135	Exponents are only "basically" defined under the natural numbers above zero.  By this I mean, defined as "iterated multiplication" the same way multiplication is defined as iterated addition.The property $a^0 = 1$ only arises when we look at generalizing multiplication to the integers.  We do this by:\begin{align} a^4 / a^3 &= (a\cdot a\cdot a\cdot a)/(a\cdot a\cdot a) = a^1\\ a^4 / a^3 &= a^{4-3}           = a^1\end{align}And using this, we can say:$$a^2 / a^3 = a^{-1} = 1/a$$and also:\begin{align}    a^2 / a^2                 &= 1\\    a^2 / a^2 &= a^{2-2} = a^0 = 1\end{align}So we say $a^0 = 1$.However, notice that these proofs don't have any meaning when $a=0$, because the whole concept/idea involves fractions, and you cannot have zero be in the denominator.When we say $2^0 = 1$, we really mean:$$ 2^{1-1} = 2^1 / 2^1 = 2/2 = 1$$But we cannot say the same for $0^0$:$$0^{1-1} = 0^1/0^1=0/0=\text{UNDEFINED}$$	9
145	139	A simple approximationx^2 = 507^2 = 49so the number is around 7.A even better approximation(7+x)^2 = 5014x + x^2 = 1 (14+x)x = 114+x = 1/xThis basically shows x is pretty small, and around 1/14, without a calculator, it's not likely you can find what exactly 1/14 is, but at least you know it be smaller than 1/10. 7.1 is a good approximation. (off by less than 0.03)	-6
146	139	Take a pair of compasses and draw an arc between two opposite corners, centred at another corner; then draw a diagonal that bisects the arc. If you now draw two lines from the point of intersection, parallel to the sides of the square, the biggest of the resulting squares will have half the area of the original square.Here's an illustration:	25

148	118	One of the greatest achievements of human civilization is Newton's laws of motions.  The first law says that unless a force is acting then the velocity (not the position!) of objects stay constant, while the second law says that forces act by causing an acceleration (though heavy objects require more force to accellerate).However to make sense of those laws and to apply them to real life you need to understand how to move between the following three notions:PositionVelocity (that is the rate of change in position)Acceleration (that is the rate of change of the velocity)Moving down that list is called "taking the derivative" while moving up that list is called "taking the integral."  Calculus is the study of derivatives and integerals.In particular, if you want to figure out how objects move under some force you need to be able to integrate twice.  This requires understanding a lot of calculus!In a first semester class you usually learn about derivatives and integrals of functions of one variable, that is what you need to understand physics in 1-dimension!  To understand the actual physics of the world you need to understand derivatives and integrals in 3-dimensions which requires several courses.	5
149	120	The main point of talking about prime numbers is Euclid's theorem that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes.  As Justin remarks, this would break horribly if $1$ were considered prime, for example we could factor $2$ as $2\times1\times1\times1\times1\times1$.  Instead we say that $1$ is not a prime, but it is the product of zero primes (see Why is $x^0 = 1$ except when $x = 0$? to understand why any prime multiplied by itself $0$ times is $1$) so Euclid's theorem works out nicely!	31
150	Are there any functions that are (always) continuous yet not differentiable? Or vice-versa?	It seems like functions that are continuous always seem to be differentiable, to me.  I can't imagine one that is not.  Are there any examples of functions that are continuous, yet not differentiable?The other way around seems a bit simpler -- a differentiable function is obviously always going to be continuous.  But are there any that do not satisfy this?	11
151	150	It's easy to find a function which is continuous but not differentiable at a single point, e.g. f(x) = |x| is continuous but not differentiable at 0.Moreover, there are functions which are continuous but nowhere differentiable, such as the Weierstrass function.On the other hand, continuity follows from differentiability, so there are no differentiable functions which aren't also continuous. If a function is differentiable at $x$, then the limit $(f(x+h)-f(x))/h$ must exist (and be finite) as $h$ tends to 0, which means $f(x+h)$ must tend to $f(x)$ as $h$ tends to 0, which means $f$ is continuous at $x$.	16
152	71	To understand the benefits of using quaternions you have to consider different ways to represent rotations. Here are few ways with a summary of the pros and cons:Euler anglesRotation matricesAxis angleQuaternions  Rotors (normalized Spinors)Euler angles are the best choice if you want a user to specify an orientation in a intuitive way. They are are also space efficient (three numbers). However, it is more difficult to linear interpolate values. Consider the case where you want to interpolate between 359 and 0 degrees. Linearly interpolating would cause a large rotation, even though the two orientations are almost the same. Writing shortest path interpolation, is easy for one axis, but non-trivial when considering the three Euler angles(for instance the shortest route between (240, 57, 145) and (35, -233, -270) is not immediately clear).Rotation matrices specify a new frame of reference using three normalized and orthogonal vectors (Right, Up, Out, which when multiplied become the new x, y, z). Rotation matrices are useful for operations like strafing (side ways movement), which only requires translating along the Right vector of the camera's rotation matrix. However, there is no clear method of interpolating between them. The are also expensive to normalize which is necessary to prevent scaling from being introduced.Axis angle, as the name suggests, are a way of specifying a rotation axis and angle to rotate around that axis. You can think of Euler angles, as three axis angle rotations, where the axises are the x, y, z axis respectively. Linearly interpolating the angle in a axis angle is pretty straight forward (if you remember to take the shortest path), however linearly interpolating between different axises is not. Quaternions are a way of specifying a rotation through a axis and the cosine of half the angle. They main advantage is I can pick any two quaternions and smoothly interpolate between them.Rotors are another way to perform rotations. Rotors are basically quaternions, but instead of thinking of them as 4D complex numbers, rotors are thought of as real 3D multivectors. This makes their visualization much more understandable (compared to quaternions), but requires fluency in geometric algebra to grasp their significance.Okay with that as the background I can discuss a real world example.   Say you are writing a computer game  where the characters are animated in  3ds Max. You need to export a  animation of the character to play in  your game, but cannot faithfully  represent the interpolation used by  the animation program, and thus have  to sample. The animation is going to  be represented as a list of rotations  for each joint. How should we store  the rotations?   If I am going to sample every frame,  not interpolate, and space is not an  issue, I would probably store the  rotations as rotation matrices. If  space was issue, then Euler angles.  That would also let me do things like  only store one angle for joints like  the knee that have only one degree of  freedom.  If I only sampled every 4 frames, and  need to interpolate it depends on  whether I am sure the frame-rate will  hold. If I am positive that the  frame-rate will hold I can use axis  angle relative rotations to perform  the interpolation. This is atypical.  In most games the frame rate can drop  past my sampling interval, which would  require skipping an element in the  list to maintain the correct playback  speed. If I am unsure of what two  orientations I need to interpolate  between, then I would use quaternions  or rotors.	12
154	Do complex numbers really exist?	Complex numbers involve the square root of negative one, and most non-mathematicians find it hard to accept that such a number is meaningful. In contrast, they feel that real numbers have an obvious and intuitive meaning. What's the best way to explain to a non-mathematician that complex numbers are necessary and meaningful, in the same way that real numbers are?This is not a Platonic question about the reality of mathematics, or whether abstractions are as real as physical entities, but an attempt to bridge a comprehension gap that many people experience when encountering complex numbers for the first time. The wording, although provocative, is deliberately designed to match the way that many people do in fact ask this question.	393
155	How can you prove that a function has no closed form integral?	I've come across statements in the past along the lines of "function $f(x)$ has no closed form integral", which I assume means that there is no combination of the operations:addition/subtractionmultiplication/divisionraising to powers and rootstrigonometric functionsexponential functionslogarithmic functionswhich when differentiated gives the function $f(x)$. I've heard this said about the function $f(x) = x^x$, for example.What sort of techniques are used to prove statements like this? What is this branch of mathematics called?Merged with "How to prove that some functions don't have a primitive" by Ismael:  Sometimes we are told that some functions like $\sin(x)/x$ don't have a indefinite integral, or that it can't be expressed in term of other simple functions.I wonder how we can prove that kind of assertion?	202
156	154	Quantum mechanics, and hence physics and everything around us, fundamentally involves complex numbers.	19
157	154	The argument isn't worth having, as you disagree about what it means for something to 'exist'. There are many interesting mathematical objects which don't have an obvious physical counterpart. What does it mean for the Monster group to exist?	6
159	154	I'll start by pointing out that a whole host of things that people think of as 'real' are on shakier ground than imaginary numbers. Given that quantum mechanics predicts a fundamental limit to how granular reality is, the whole concept of real numbers is on very shakey ground, yet people accept those as fine. I'd therefore suggest that it is merely a case of familiarity - people are less familiar with complex numbers than with some other mathematical constructs.As for an actual existence outside the realms of pure maths... your best bet is to look at quantum mechanics again. This area has some fascinating results that are only possible through the use of imaginary numbers. Incidentally, fundamental particles are the place in nature that gave a 'physicality' to negative numbers (the charge of an electron is negative) well after they were accepted as normal by most people. 	15
160	154	The concept of mathematical numbers and "existing" is a tricky one.  What actually "exists"?Do negative numbers exist?  Of course they do not.  You can't have a negative number of apples.Yet, the beauty of negative numbers is that when we define them (rigorously), then all of a sudden we can use them to solve problems we were never ever able to solve before, or we can solve them in a much simpler way.Imagine trying to do simple physics without the idea of negative numbers!But are they "real"?  Do they "exist"?  No, they don't.  But they are just tools that help us solve real life problems.To go back to your question about complex numbers, I would say that the idea that they exist or not has no bearing on whether they are actually useful in solving the problems of every day life, or making them many, many, many times more easy to solve.The math that makes your computer run involves the tool that is complex numbers, for instance.	155
161	2	Conceptually, to me at least, a limit is a way approximate something, by realizing the long run behavior is predictable and more important then the short term behavior. Let's say your baby sitting a rambunctious kid. You could frustrate yourself trying to quite him, or just realize, in the limit he will tire himself out.A lot of systems seem complicated in the short term, but are simple when viewed in the long term. The limit is way to take advantage of that, and relate a complex system to a simpler approximation. 	1
162	Why is "the set of all sets" a paradox?	I've heard of some other paradoxes involving sets (ie, "the set of all sets that do not contain themselves") and I understand how paradoxes arise from them.  But this one I do not understand.Why is "the set of all sets" a paradox?  It seems like it would be fine, to me.  There is nothing paradoxical about a set containing itself.Is it something that arises from the "rules of sets" that are involved in more rigorous set theory?EDIT: I don't really have much of a background with Set Theory, so an answer that deals with common english would be much appreciated =)	63
163	155	It is a theorem of Liouville, reproven later with purely algebraic methods, that for rational functions $f$ and $g$, $g$ nonconstant, the antiderivative$$\int [f(x)\exp(g(x))] \, \mathrm dx$$can be expressed in terms of elementary functions if and only if there exists some rational function $h$ such that it is a solution to the differential equation:$$f = h' + hg$$$\int e^{x^2} dx$ is another classic example of such a function with no elementary antiderivative.I don't know how much math you've had, but some of this paper might be comprehensible in its broad strokes: http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~ksda/PostedPapers/liouv06.pdfLiouville's original paper:  Liouville, J. "Suite du Mémoire sur la classification des Transcendantes, et sur l'impossibilité d'exprimer les racines de certaines équations en fonction finie explicite des coefficients." J. Math. Pure Appl. 3, 523-546, 1838. Michael Spivak's book on Calculus also has a section with a discussion of this.	85
164	Why is the volume of a sphere $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$?	I learned that the volume of a sphere is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, but why? The $\pi$ kind of makes sense because its round like a circle, and the $r^3$ because it's 3-D, but $\frac{4}{3}$ is so random! How could somebody guess something like this for the formula?	77
166	97	You can use a Taylor polynomial of sufficient degree to guarantee the accuracy that you need.  (The Taylor series for erf(x) is given on the Wikipedia page to which you linked.)  The Lagrange Remainder term can be used to bound the error in the Taylor series approximation.	4
167	154	There are geometric interpretations of imaginary numbers where they are thought of as parallelograms with a front and back, or oriented parallelograms. That interpretation requires geometric algebra but only uses real numbers. Here is a link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra#Complex_numbersThat doesn't have any pictures so it is admittedly not intuitive, but the answer is yes. Whether you think of imaginary numbers as square root of negative 1 or as parallelogram with a front and back, they exist.	8
168	154	There are a few good answers to this question, depending on the audience. I've used all of these on occasion.A way to solve polynomialsWe came up with equations like $x - 5 = 0$, what is $x$?, and the naturals solved them (easily). Then we asked, "wait, what about $x + 5 = 0$?" So we invented negative numbers. Then we asked "wait, what about $2x = 1$?" So we invented rational numbers. Then we asked "wait, what about $x^2 = 2$?" so we invented irrational numbers.Finally, we asked, "wait, what about $x^2 = -1$?" This is the only question that was left, so we decided to invent the "imaginary" numbers to solve it. All the other numbers, at some point, didn't exist and didn't seem "real", but now they're fine. Now that we have imaginary numbers, we can solve every polynomial, so it makes sense that that's the last place to stop.Pairs of numbersThis explanation goes the route of redefinition. Tell the listener to forget everything he or she knows about imaginary numbers. You're defining a new number system, only now there are always pairs of numbers. Why? For fun. Then go through explaining how addition/multiplication work. Try and find a good "realistic" use of pairs of numbers (many exist).Then, show that in this system,  $(0,1) * (0,1) = (-1,0)$, in other words, we've defined a new system, under which it makes sense to say that $\sqrt{-1} = i$, when $i=(0,1)$. And that's really all there is to imaginary numbers: a definition of a new number system, which makes sense to use in most places. And under that system, there is an answer to $\sqrt{-1}$.The historical explanationExplain the history of the imaginary numbers. Showing that mathematicians also fought against them for a long time helps people understand the mathematical process, i.e., that it's all definitions in the end.I'm a little rusty, but I think there were certain equations that kept having parts of them which used $\sqrt{-1}$, and the mathematicians kept  throwing out the equations since there is no such thing.Then, one mathematician decided to just "roll with it", and kept working, and found out that all those square roots cancelled each other out.Amazingly, the answer that was left was the correct answer (he was working on finding roots of polynomials, I think). Which lead him to think that there was a valid reason to use $\sqrt{-1}$, even if it took a long time to understand it.	301
169	164	This was first "guessed at" by Archimedes, by what fraction of the volume of a cylinder a sphere is.  That is, a sphere that is contained within that cylinder.  From that, he figured out $4/3$.You can do it these days with the tools of calculus.  One way would to use the [Disk Method], over the graph of a semicircle.  Another would be to use spherical coordinates and calculate the 3D Integral.All of these methods should give you $\frac{4}{3} \pi  r^3$Note that it's not just $r^3$ because it's "3D"; but also because it's the only way the dimensional analysis would work; that is, the units would have to be in $\text{distance}^3$.  But that might be what you said, but just clarifying.                                      	9
170	120	It's important to understand that this is not something that can be proved: it's a definition. We choose not to regard 1 as a prime number, simply because it makes writing lots of theorems much easier.Noah gives the best example in his answer: Euclid's theorem that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes. If 1 is defined to be a prime number, then we'd have to change that theorem to: "every positive integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes, except for infinite multiplications by 1". So we choose to go with the easier path of defining 1 to not be a prime.	44
171	162	Let $|S|$ be the cardinality of $S$$|S| < |2^S|$ can be proven with generalized Cantor's diagonal argumentProof of the set of all sets doesn't exist:Let $S$ be the set of all sets,$|S| < |2^S|$but $2^S$ is a subset of $S$, because every set in $2^S$ is in $S$. Therefore$|2^S| \leq |S|$A contradiction. Therefore the set of all sets doesn't exist.	70

174	164	Pappus's centroid theorem (second theorem) says that the volume of a solid formed by revolving a region about an axis is the product of the area of the region and the distance traveled by the centroid of the region when it is revolved.  A sphere can be formed by revolving a semicircle about is diameter edge.The area of the semicircle is $\frac{1}{2}\pi r^2$.  The centroid of the semicircle can be found by intersecting two lines that both divide the area of the semicircle into two equal parts.  One such line is perpendicular to the diameter edge through the center of the semicircle (this is a line of symmetry of the semicircle).  Another such line is parallel to the diameter edge, $\frac{4r}{3\pi}$ away from it (verification of this is left as an exercise for the reader).  When revolved about the diameter edge of the semicircle, the centroid travels $2\pi\cdot\frac{4r}{3\pi} = \frac{8}{3}\cdot r$, so the volume of the sphere is $\frac{1}{2}\pi r^2\cdot\frac{8}{3}\cdot r = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.	14
175	118	Calculus is the mathematics of change. In algebra, almost nothing ever changes. Here's a comparison of some algebra vs. calc problems:algebra: car A is driving at 50 kph. How far has it gone after 6 hours?calc: car B starts at 10 mph and begins accelerating at the rate of 10 kph^2(kilometers per hour per hour). How far has car B gone after 6 hours?Note how the algebra problem nothing changes, where in the calc problem, the speed of the car is constantly changing.calc: If a ball is rolling in a straight line at 10 fps with a diameter of 1 footand Q is a the point at the top of the ball when t=0, how fast is point Q moving at time t=4 relative to the ground?The speed of the point in relation to the ground is never the same (its zero when its at the bottom, 20fps when it's at the top. Calculus lets you figure out how fast it's going exactly at a specific moment. There are two main branches of calculus, differential and integral. These problems pertain to differential calculus as they concern how something is changing. Integral calculus deals with how much something has changed, the opposite of differential calculus. The number of cubic feet of oxygen circulated by Jeff lungs per hour at time t follows the equation f(t) = t^3 + sin(t) How many cubic feet of oxygen do Jeff's lungs cycle per day?To find out how much something has changed when its rate of change isn't constant requires integral calculus. (the equation is purely hypothetical unless Jeff happens to be the size of a beluga whale).	2

178	154	We will will first consider the most common definition of $i$, as the square root of $-1$. When you first hear this, it sounds crazy. $0$ squared is $0$; a positive times a positive is positive and a negative times a negative is positive too. So there doesn't actually appear to be any number that we can square to get $-1$.A mathematician would collectively term $0$, negative numbers and positive numbers as the real numbers. They would also define the term complex numbers as a group of numbers that includes these real numbers. So while we have shown that no real number can square to get $-1$, we haven't even defined complex numbers at this point, so we can't rule out that one might have this property.At this point, it makes sense to ask what does a mathematician mean by a number? It certainly isn't what most people associate it with - as an abstract representation some kind of real world quantity. We need to understand that it isn't uncommon for one word to have different meanings for different groups of people - after all words mean whatever we make them mean. Most people only need to real world quantities, so they find it convenient to call those numbers. On the other hand, mathematicians explore a variety of different number systems. Indeed some, such as complex numbers, are useful for solving problems that are actually about real numbers.So mathematicians define $i$ as a number that obeys most of the normal algebraic laws. They also defined $i*i$ to equal $-1$. From this we can derive all of the standard results about complex numbers.As for whether they are real - it depends on what you want to know. Obviously, they don't correspond to quantities of physical objects. On the other hand, complex numbers can useful for representing resistance in an electric circuit. Ultimately, they are an idea and while ideas don't exist physically, saying they don't exist at all is inaccurate.	4
179	162	An informal explanation is Russel's Paradox. The wiki page is informative, here's the relevant quote:  Let us call a set "abnormal" if it is  a member of itself, and "normal"  otherwise. For example, take the set  of all squares. That set is not itself  a square, and therefore is not a  member of the set of all squares. So  it is "normal". On the other hand, if  we take the complementary set that  contains all non-squares, that set is  itself not a square and so should be  one of its own members. It is  "abnormal".   Now we consider the set of  all normal sets, R. Attempting to  determine whether R is normal or  abnormal is impossible: If R were a  normal set, it would be contained in  the set of normal sets (itself), and  therefore be abnormal; and if it were  abnormal, it would not be contained in  the set of normal sets (itself), and  therefore be normal. This leads to the  conclusion that R is both normal and  abnormal: Russell's paradox.	2
180	75	I won't explain what a ring or a group is, because that's already been done, but I'll add something else.  One reason groups and rings feel similar is that they are both "algebraic structures" in the sense of universal algebra. So for instance, the operation of quotienting via a normal subgroup (for a group) and a two-sided ideal (for a ring) are basically instances of quotienting via an invariant equivalence relation in universal algebra.  A field, by contrast, is not really a construction of universal algebra (because the operation $x \to x^{-1}$ is not everywhere defined) -- which is why free fields don't exist, for instance -- though they are a special case of rings.  	13
181	164	In addition to the methods of calculus, Pappus, and Archimedes already mentioned, Cavalieri's Principle can be useful for these kinds of problems.Suppose you have two solid figures lined up next to each other, each fitting between the same two parallel planes. (E.g., two stacks of pennies lying on the table, of the same height). Then, consider cutting the two solids by a plane parallel to the given two and in between them. If the cross-sectional area thus formed is the same for each of the solids for any such plane, the volumes of the solids are the same.If you're willing to accept that you know the volume of a cone is 1/3 that of the cylinder with the same base and height, you can use Cavalieri, comparing a hemisphere to a cylinder with an inscribed cone, to get the volume of the sphere. This diagram (from Wikipedia) illustrates the construction: look hereConsider a cylinder of radius $R$ and height $R$, with, inside it, an inverted cone, with base of radius $R$ coinciding with the top of the cylinder, and again height $R$. Put next to it a hemisphere of radius $R$. Now consider the cross section of each at height $y$ above the base. For the cylinder/cone system, the area of the cross-section is $\pi (R^2-y^2)$. It's the same for the hemisphere cross-section, as you can see by doing the Pythagorean theorem with any vector from the sphere center to a point on the sphere at height y to get the radius of the cross section (which is circular).Since the cylinder/cone and hemisphere have the same height, by Cavalieri's Principle the volumes of the two are equal. The cylinder volume is $\pi R^3$, the cone is a third that, so the hemisphere volume is $\frac{2}{3} \pi R^3$. Thus the sphere of radius $R$ has volume $\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3$. 	59
183	136	alt text http://www.education.vic.gov.au/images/content/studentlearning/mathscontinuum/SquareNos_sml.gifDan's algebraic justification is correct, but you may get more intuition about why this is happening from the above picture. Each time you want to enlarge the square by one unit, you have to add an extra row, an extra column, and one more square to fill in the corner. These correspond directly to the $n+n+1=2n+1$ that Dan mentioned. And of course, $2n+1$ is how odd numbers look.  Looking at it from the other direction, you can use the same idea to convince yourself of Noah's claim that $1+3+5+\dots+(2n-1) = n^2$. Imagine the left-hand side as representing the upper sequence of green and orange squares. You add on first 1 tile, then 3, then 5, and so on to construct larger and larger squares. At each step, you are adding one row (n) and one column (another n), then removing that one tile in the top right corner where they overlap (for a total of 2n-1). 	25
184	83	I have found most people liked math at some point, but something happened in their learning process that made them feel so stupid, they became disenfranchised with mathematics.What tends to happen is students are presented with some mathematically result they are expected to memorize by route, which takes all the joy out of mathematics and prevents them from approaching mathematics intuitively.So I would first try to zero in on what they don't like and what parts of mathematics they have had to take on faith. You might not have to excite them if you help them learn mathematics intuitively.As per the suggestions, I would show them how mathematically equations make pretty shapes in Processing.	9
185	Recasting points from one vector space to another	I have a collection of 3D points in the standard $x$, $y$, $z$ vector space. Now I pick one of the points $p$ as a new origin and two other points $a$ and $b$ such that $a - p$ and $b - p$ form two vectors of a new vector space. The third vector of the space I will call $x$ and calculate that as the cross product of the first two vectors.Now I would like to recast or reevaluate each of the points in my collection in terms of the new vector space. How do I do that?(Also, if 'recasting' not the right term here, please correct me.)	4
187	Euclidean Tilings that are Uniform but not Vertex-Transitive	Basic definitions: a tiling of d-dimensional Euclidean space is a decomposition of that space into polyhedra such that there is no overlap between their interiors, and every point in the space is contained in some one of the polyhedra.A vertex-uniform tiling is a tiling such that each vertex figure is the same: each vertex is contained in the same number of k-faces, etc: the view of the tiling is the same from every vertex.A vertex-transitive tiling is one such that for every two vertices in the tiling, there exists an element of the symmetry group taking one to the other.Clearly all vertex-transitive tilings are vertex-uniform. For n=2, these notions coincide. However, Grunbaum, in his book on tilings, mentions but does not explain that for n >= 3, there exist vertex uniform tilings that are not vertex transitive. Can someone provide an example of such a tiling, or a reference that explains this?	4
188	154	No number does "really exist" the way trees or atoms exist.In physics people however have found use for complex numbers just as they have found use for real numbers.	78
190	11	If you take two real numbers x and y then there per definition of the real number z for which x < z < y or x > z > y is true.For x = 0.99999... and y = 1 you can't find a z and therefore 0.99999... = 1.	16
191	177	I'm going to use $P(a,b)$ for probability of x = a, and y = b.$P(a,b) = P[x = |a|]P[y = |b|] * 1/4$ for any a, b inside the square.Therefore you are picking a coordinate uniformly inside the square.Now the problem reduced to the following:Pick a element uniformly in a set A, then discard ones that are not B (B is a subset of A). Is it the same as pick a element uniformly in the set $A \cap B = B$?I think this is true, I don't know if the following is a formal proof(haven't done probability in a while). please point out my mistakes.P(B) is the event that a element in B is picked. P(A) is the event that a element in A is picked.Pick a x uniformly, we have b \in B is P(x=b|B), it's obviously uniform.The conditional probability P(B|A) = P(A \cap B)/P(A) = P(B)/P(A) = P(B) P(A) = 1, w/e you pick are in A.P(x=b| (B|A)) = P(x=b|B), which is uniform.Answer to your question: It is uniformly distributed. 	0
193	185	You are changing your basis vectors, call your new ones $i$, $j$, and $k$ where $i$ is defined from $a-p$, $j$ from $b-p$, and $k$ the cross product. Now recall that your basis vectors should be unit, so take the length of your three vectors and divide the vectors by their length, making $i$, $j$, and $k$ unit. Now $a = d(a,p)*i$, $b = d(b,p)*j$.	3
194	Distribution of primes?	Do primes become more or less frequent as you go further out on the number line?  That is, are there more or fewer primes between $1$ and $1,000,000$ than between $1,000,000$ and $2,000,000$?A proof or pointer to a proof would be appreciated.	13
195	185	What you are describing is an Affine Transformation, which is a linear transformation followed by a translation.We know this because any straight lines in your original vector space is also going to be a straight line in your transformed vector space.	2
196	How does the wheel paradox work?	I keep looking at this picture and its driving me crazy. How can the smaller circle travel the same distance when its circumference is less than the entire wheel? demonstration image http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/gifs/AristotlesWheel.gif	29
197	196	If the two circles are fixed, then they will be traveling the same difference, but at different velocities.In fact, the ratio of the radii is equal to the ratio of the velocities a point on either circle will be traveling.If you tried to repeat this by putting two different-sized circles on a track and making them spin to come out to be the same distance with the same angular velocity, you will notice that one of the circles will have to slide/slip along the track in order to keep them at the same pace.	11
199	194	From the Wikipedia article about the prime number theorem:  Roughly speaking, the prime number  theorem states that if a random number  nearby some large number N is  selected, the chance of it being prime  is about 1 / ln(N), where ln(N)  denotes the natural logarithm of N.  For example, near N = 10,000, about  one in nine numbers is prime, whereas  near N = 1,000,000,000, only one in  every 21 numbers is prime. In other  words, the average gap between prime  numbers near N is roughly ln(N).	15
200	162	The "set of all sets" is not so much a paradox in itself as something  that inevitably leads to a contradiction, namely the well-known (and referenced in the question) Russell's paradox.Given any set and a predicate applying to sets, the set of all things satisfying the predicate should be a subset of the original set.  If the "set of all sets" were to exist, because self-containment and non-self-containment are valid predicates, the set of all sets not containing themselves would have to exist as a set in order for our set theory to be consistent.  But this "set of all sets" cannot exist in a consistent set theory because of the Russel paradox.So the non-existence of the "set of all sets" is a consequence of the fact that presuming it's existence would lead to the contradiction described by Russel's paradox.This is in fact the origin of Russel's paradox. In his work "The Basic Laws of Arithmetic", Gottlob Frege had taken as a postulate the existence of this "set of all sets".  In a letter to Frege, Bertrand Russell essentially blew away the basis of Frege's entire work by describing the paradox and proving that this postulate could not be a part of a consistent set theory.	19
201	Is there possibly a largest prime number?	Prime numbers are numbers with no factors other than one and itself.Factors of a number are always lower or equal to than a given number; so, the larger the number is, the larger the pool of "possible factors" that number might have.So the larger the number, it seems like the less likely the number is to be a prime.Surely there must be a number where, simply, every number above it has some other factors.  A "critical point" where every number larger than it simply will always have some factors other than one and itself.Has there been any research as to finding this critical point, or has it been proven not to exist?  That for any $n$ there is always guaranteed to be a number higher than $n$ that has no factors other than one and itself?	30
202	155	Surprisingly, there is a procedure for determining this, called the Risch Algorithm. However, it is apparently very complicated to implement, and furthermore it is not a true algorithm: if the input does have an anti-derivative, it can find it in a finite amount of time, but demonstrating there is no anti-derivative requires solving the constant problem, which can fail to halt. (In that case, probabilistic methods can be used.)	28
203	198	The distinction between constructive mathematics and traditional mathematics has nothing to do with Russell's Paradox.Constructive mathematics simply requires working with one less basic postulate that many mathematicians have believed to be sensible and on which some proofs are based, namely the Axiom of Choice	1
204	201	No there is not, here is a collection of proofs;http://math.mit.edu/~ssam/writings/primes.pdf	12
205	29	Personally, I always use Python's console.It has history and allows all kinds of math operations.It is available for Linux, Windows, Mac, ChromeOS, Android, and others.	12
206	What exactly does it mean for a function to be "well-behaved"?	Often in my studies (economics) the assumption of a "well-behaved" function will be invoked. I don't exactly know what that entails (I think twice continuously differentiability is one of the requirements), nor do I know why this is necessary (though I imagine the why will depend on each case).Can someone explain it to me, and if there is an explanation of the why as well, I would be grateful. Thanks! EDIT: To give one example where the term appears, see this Wikipedia entry for utility functions, which says at one point:  In order to simplify calculations,  various assumptions have been made of  utility functions.       CES (constant elasticity of substitution, or  isoelastic) utility  Exponential utility  Quasilinear utility  Homothetic preferences   Most utility functions  used in modeling or theory are  well-behaved. They are usually  monotonic, quasi-concave, continuous  and globally non-satiated.I might be wrong, but I don't think "well-behaved" means monotonic, quasi-concave, continuous and globally non-satiated. What about twice differentiable?	23
209	29	I use R these days. It was build to be a calculator and does the job well. It's syntax might be a bit strange but it allows you to do a lot with little typing.	7
210	198	A whole bunch of things in mathematics are inherently nonconstructive. For instance, invariant theory--recall the famous quote by Gordan that Hilbert's mathematics was "theology." (A quote which, I believe, was in jest.) The Hahn-Banach theorem, a fundamental tool in functional analysis (and a great tool for proving all sorts of results, like approximation results--Runge's theorem, the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, and more) relies on the axiom of choice, and is consequently nonconstructive.  The fact that any proper ideal in a ring is contained in a maximal ideal is frequently used in algebra, and yet it needs the axiom of choice.  The use of ultraproducts in logic (or the construction of hyperreal numbers) is inherently nonconstructive: you can't just exhibit a nonprincipal ultrafilter on the natural numbers.Basically, a lot of mathematics just doesn't work without Zorn's lemma, and this is equivalent to the axiom of choice.  	8
211	201	Euclid's famous proof is as follows: Suppose there is a finite number of primes.  Let $x$ be the product of all of these primes.  Then look at $x+1$.  It is clear that $x$ is coprime to $x+1$.  Therefore, no nontrivial factor of $x$ is a factor of $x+1$, but every prime is a factor of $x$.  By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, $x+1$ admits a prime factorization, and by the above remark, none of these prime factors can be a factor of $x$, but $x$ is the product of all primes.  This is a contradiction.	42
212	201	According to XKCD, we have the following Haiku:Top Prime's Divisors'Product (Plus one)'s factors are...?Q.E.D B@%&$I wonder if we can edit it to make it correct	7
213	Mathematical subjects you wish you learned earlier	I am learning geometric algebra, and it is incredible how much it helps me understand other branches of mathematics. I wish I had been exposed to it earlier. Additionally I feel the same way about enumerative combinatorics. What are some less popular mathematical subjects that you think should be more popular?	59
214	162	As others have explained, the existence of universal set is incompatible with the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms of set theory. However, there are alternative set theories which admit a universal set. One such theory is Quine's New Foundations.	32
215	206	The short answer is that there is no "exact" meaning. Ideally, additional axioms are introduced to ensure that a certain function (or any mathematical object, for that matter) is "well-behaved" which, in effect, makes analysis easier. So, the meaning of "well-behaved" should be derived from those specific additional axioms.	9
216	83	I think ideas like cardinality are suitable for getting kids interested in math -- the notion of a one-to-one correspondence is easy to grasp, and the proof of the uncountability of the reals is great fun.  Also, elementary number theory can be useful.  This is the sort of thing that would be especially useful for, say, contest math, which is where a lot of kids get interested in math.In general, popular math books can be a good source of ideas.	8
217	155	Brian Conrad explains this in the following:Impossibility theorems on integration in elementary terms -pdf	13
218	177	Yes this will work; it's called rejection sampling.Even better is to generate a point in polar coordinates though:  pick θ from [0, 2π) and r2 from [0, R2] (ie. multiply R by the square-root of a random number in [0, 1] - without the square-root it is non-uniform).	16
219	83	Besides all of these mathematics topics, I would contend that it is equally as important to show them the more human side of the subject.  Mathematics has a history and a culture that is accessible and exciting to some people.  Of course there are the exciting lives of Pascal and Galois, but there is also the story of Bourbaki (and the individual stories of their various members).  Also, introducing children to actual mathematicians/engineers/scientists is a great way to motivate their interest in the subject.  Let them see that mathematics has not been borne from the head of Zeus, that it is a living and breathing subject.  	14
221	213	Though I'm sure it's not unpopular, I don't think many people learn it early: Group Theory. It's a real nice area with a lot of cool math and some neat applications (like cryptography).	24
222	213	I don't really think that graph theory is a "less popular mathematical subject," but I certainly wish I had been exposed to it earlier.	4
223	213	Theory of computation, information theory and logic/foundation of mathematics are very interesting topics. I wish I knew them earlier. They are not unpopular(almost every university have a bunch of ToC people in CS depatment...) , but many math major I know have never touched them.They show you the limits of mathematics, computation and communication.Logic shows there are things can't be proved from a set of axioms even if it's true--Godel's incompleteness theorem. There are other interesting theorems in foundation of mathematics. Like the independence of continuum hypothesis to ZFC.Theory of computation showed me things that's not computable. Problems that takes exponential time, exponential space, no matter what kind of algorithm you come up with.Information theory proves the minimum amount of information required to reconstruct some other information. It pops up in unexpected places. There is a proof of there are infinite number of primes by information theory (Sorry I can't find it, I can only tell you it exists. I might find it later).	6
224	154	Are real numbers "real"?  It's not even computationally possible to compare two real numbers for equality!Interestingly enough, it is shown in Abstract Algebra courses that the idea of complex numbers arises naturally from the idea of real numbers - you could not say, for instance, that the real numbers are valid but the complex numbers aren't (whatever your definition of valid is...)	12
225	213	I don't know what level of mathematics you are referring to, but here's my opinion after recently finishing my university's undergraduate curriculum.  Firstly, I would like to second Jan Gorzny's reply of Group Theory.Second, I wish that I had learned linear algebra earlier.  The topic usually has two semesters: matrix algebra and then an early proof-based introduction to vector spaces and linear transformations.  The real work in this topic can't begin until after both of these classes are completed.I also wish I had been exposed to topology earlier than I was.  Of course there are two "standard" approaches here, and I suppose the approach that introduces general topology before advanced calculus would have better suited my tastes.Here is a good book that may give some more insight into the heavily debated area where your question lies: Thomas Garrity, All the Mathematics You Missed But Need to Know for Graduate School	8
226	206	In general, we think of well-behaved functions as simpler, somehow. In any field, we might want to limit ourselves to considering only well-behaved functions in order to avoid having to deal with nasty edge cases. And in each of these domains, the community is free to choose whatever definition of 'well-behaved' makes sense for them. A quick look at the wiki link that e.James posted will show you the diversity in ideas of what it means to be well-behaved. I am no economist, so I will take for granted that the definition you put forth in your question is the one in common use. I can see twice-differentiable as a reasonable requirement for a utility function to be 'well-behaved' is because the derivative of the utility function is marginal utility, and economists often care about the derivative of marginal utility. For example, if the second derivative of utility is negative, this means that the marginal utility has a negative derivative in other words, additional quantity of the good or service does not add utility as quickly. Also commonly referred to as diminishing returns.If we want to be able to take the derivative even once, of course, we need the function to be continuous. You probably don't need to worry about the formal definition here. Pencil test should work fine.The requirement for utility to be monotonic means that it is either always increasing or always decreasing. In other words, that a particular good or service is either desirable or not. If 10 widgets were good, 20 must be better. Of course, as mentioned above, maybe not that much better.Monotonic means that it will also be quasi-concave. (Except for weird stuff like a flat function) That is, they have at most one local maximum. We would prefer that functions be quasiconcave because we wish to avoid cases like the one below. It just makes it so much easier to optimize when you only have one possible maximum to worry about.Globally non-satiated someone else can talk about. I don't know enough to be sure I won't just be misleading you further.	6
227	Which 4 maths courses to take as an Economics PhD student?	I am doing a PhD in economics and I have the chance of taking one subject a semester in the maths department (I would like to do more, but "unfortunately" I have to work on my thesis). I want to have a plan so that I start with subjects I might know a bit but making sure I have all the basis, while at the same time ensuring I get the chance to sit in more advanced courses. My plan, for now, is the following:(I am skipping calculus I and II, because even though I don't know all of it, I know enough I think to be able to do the next course without trouble)Linear Algebra  Real Analysis     Discrete Maths and Operations Research orEngineering Maths orGroup Theory and Linear Algebra  Numerical & Symbolic Mathematics orVector CalculusCan you anyone give me a hand on making the decision or giving suggestions? In economics we use software such as matlab, lots of differentiation, Euler equations, difference equations, dynamic programming, statistical analysis (but for that I plan on taking Probability and Stochastic Modelling). 	16
228	Proof that the sum of two Gaussian variables is another Gaussian	The sum of two Gaussian variables is another Gaussian.It seems natural, but I could not find a proof using Google.What's a short way to prove this?Thanks!Edit: Provided the two variables are independent.	9
229	196	That picture confuses things by making it look as though the red line is being "unwound" from the circle like paper towel being unwound from a roll. Our brains pick up on that, since it is a real-world example.Both circles complete a single revolution, and both travel the same distance from left to right. If these really were rolls of paper towel, the smaller roll would have to spin faster (and therefore complete more than one full revolution) in order to lay out the same length of paper towel as the larger roll. Alternatively, if the two rolls were spinning at the same rate, the free end of the strip of towel left behind by the smaller roll would also move to the right.In short, the image is a kind of optical/mental illusion, and you're not going crazy :)	25
230	227	You may consider focusing on Operations Research, and anything numerical.  I think you can pick up the tools of vector calculus as you go (which for your specialty will mostly be partial-differentiation, I think).  Maybe you can take two semesters of OR and a semester of something like Numerical Solutions to PDE, and one of Numerical Linear Algebra or Numerical Analysis.And, I suppose all of this depends on what you plan to do with Econ.	2
231	227	If you do take vector calculus, it's probably best taken before real analysis (where you'll learn many of the results from vector calc in a more general setting). If it were me, I'd take discrete math and operations research over the other two in (3), because they'll be useful for economics and because those subjects are the most different from linear algebra and real analysis. The group theory wouldn't, as far as I know, be tremendously applicable to economics except as it relates to analysis, and you'll get a sense of an algebraic way of thinking through linear. Numerical and symbolic math, if it includes numerical analysis, would be very relevant.A main criterion I am using here is that you'll want to learn more math as you go on in econ, and so the most important thing, for your ability to learn various things on your own later and for developing an appreciation for different kinds of math, is to take courses that cover many different kinds of mathematical thinking (including that which is more directly relevant to econ and other applied areas).	9
232	228	I don't know how I missed that one, indeed:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_normally_distributed_random_variablesThanks Kaestur Hakarl!	1
233	123	On a map using the Mercator projection, the relationship between the latitude L of a point and its y coordinate on the map is given by $y = \operatorname{arctanh}(\sin(L))$, where $\operatorname{arctanh}$ is the inverse of the hyperbolic tangent function.	14
234	Card doubling paradox	Suppose there are two face down cards each with a positive real number and with one twice the other. Each card has value equal to its number. You are given one of the cards (with value $x$) and after you have seen it, the dealer offers you an opportunity to swap without anyone having looked at the other card.If you choose to swap, your expected value should be the same, as you still have a $50\%$ chance of getting the higher card and $50\%$ of getting the lower card.However, the other card has a $50\%$ chance of being $0.5x$ and a $50\%$ chance of being $2x$. If we keep the card, our expected value is $x$, while if we swap it, then our expected value is:$$0.5(0.5x)+0.5(2x)=1.25x$$so it seems like it is better to swap. Can anyone explain this apparent contradiction?	24
235	154	To the degree that anything actually "exists" in math, yes complex number exist.Once you accept that groups, rings and fields exist, and that isomorphism of rings makes sense, complex numbers can be recognized as (isomorphic to) the subring (which happens to be a field) of the ring of $2 \times 2$ real matrices.Generators of this subring are the following matrices$        \begin{vmatrix}        1 & 0 \\        0 & 1 \\        \end{vmatrix}\;$and$\;        \begin{vmatrix}        0 & -1 \\        1 & 0 \\        \end{vmatrix}$which correspond to $1$ and $i$ in the normal notation of complex numbers.As people tend to accept that matrices exist, this may be a convincing argument. 	28
236	227	During my graduate studies, I had a friend who was extremely interested in differential topology and focused on that in his work toward an MS in math.In his PhD work, he switched to Economics, but was still essentially doing Differential Topology.Economics can get just as abstract as math!	2
237	How do you determine if a point sits inside a polygon?	Given the coordinates of a point $(x, y)$, what is a procedure for determining if it lies within a polygon whose vertices are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots , (x_n,y_n)$?	7
238	237	I will assume the polygon has no intersections between the edges except at corners. Call the point $(x_0, y_0)$. First we determine whether we are on a line - this is simple using substitution and range checking. For the range checking, suppose we have a segment $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$. We check that $x_1\leq x_0\leq x_2$ or $x_2\leq x_0\leq x_1$ and do the same for $y$.Now, if we aren't on a line, we draw a ray from the point and count how many lines you intersect. If the line doesn't intersect a corner or contain a non-degenerate segment of an edge, then an odd number of intersections should mean you are inside and an even number mean outside.If we intersect with a corner, it is more difficult. Clearly, the ray could leave with it only intersecting a corner, but it could also pass through the corner without entering the polygon. One solution is to pick the ray so that it doesn't intersect a corner or go along a line - this should always be possible. We can also use cross product to determine whether we are crossing the lines at their corner or not (just check if the adjacent vertices are on the same side of the line or not).	8
239	83	When I was that age, I discovered Raymond Smullyan's classic logic puzzle books in the library (such as What is the name of this book?), and really got into it. I remember my amazement when I first understood how a complicated logic puzzle could become trivial, just symbolic manipulation really, with the right notation.	4
240	Are the "proofs by contradiction" weaker than other proofs?	I remember hearing several times the advice that, we should avoid using a proof by contradiction, if it is simple to convert to a direct proof or a proof by contrapositive.  Could you explain the reason?  Do logicians think that proofs by contradiction are somewhat weaker than direct proofs?Edit: To clarify the question.  I am wondering, if there is any reason that one would still continue looking for a direct proof of some theorem, although a proof by contradiction has already been found.  I don't mean improvements in terms of elegance or exposition, I am asking about logical reasons.  For example, in the case of axiom of choice, there is obviously reason to look for a proof that does not use the axiom of choice.  Is there a similar case for proofs by contradiction?	83
241	240	Nearly always the direct proof is easier to understand, shorter, and more helpful!	2
242	240	Sometimes you might want to know not just that there exists something, you might want to know how to actually go about finding it (and related questions like how quickly you can find it).  Proofs by contradiction are non-constructive, while direct proofs are typically constructive in the sense that they actually construct an answer.For example, the proof that there are infinitely many primes usually proceeds by contradiction.  However, you can make it a direct proof which gives the stronger result that the nth prime is less than e^{e^n}.  (This is a good exercise to work out for yourself, but you can also find it as Prop 1.1.3 in my senior thesis and probably many other places as well.)	5
243	240	Most logicians consider proofs by contradiction to be equally valid, however some people are constructivists/intuitionists and don't consider them valid.  (Edit: This is not strictly true, as explained in comments. Only certain proofs by contradiction are problematic from the constructivist point of view, namely those that prove "A" by assuming "not A" and getting a contradiction.  In my experience, this is usually exactly the situation that people have in mind when saying "proof by contradiction.")One possible reason that the constructivist point of view makes a certain amount of sense is that statements like the continuum hypothesis are independent of the axioms, so it's a bit weird to claim that it's either true or false, in a certain sense it's neither.Nonetheless constructivism is a relatively uncommon position among mathematicians/logicians.  However, it's not considered totally nutty or beyond the pale.  Fortunately, in practice most proofs by contradiction can be translated into constructivist terms and actual constructivists are rather adept at doing so.  So the rest of us mostly don't bother worrying about this issue, figuring it's the constructivists problem.	17
244	83	Speaking from my own experience with elementary mathematics, yours is a very hard question to answer because there is little in the elementary math curriculum worth getting excited about. Before students are going to get excited about math, the math curriculum has to be changed so that the process of doing mathematics is made to be engaging and thought provoking - not tedious. I think every teacher of elementary mathematics needs to watch this video about how math education can and should be reformed.	2
245	240	At first this seems like a silly question - after all isn't the point of a mathematical proof to be a proof and hence to be beyond question. But of course, to prove anything we need assumptions and some people do disagree with the axioms commonly used by mathematicians. I don't have much knowledge of this view, but I am sure they have theorems that show that contradiction like proofs are valid (given their axioms) within certain conditions. I would recommend going along with what everyone else does and treating "proofs by contradiction" as equally valid, unless you have investigated the Constructivism view and you decide that they are correct.As to whether they are clearer, that will depend on the actual proof. Sometimes the clearest way to make a proof is to start from the assumptions and see what they are really saying and why that is going to lead to a contradiction. The most illustrative proof depends on the circumstances.	-1

248	206	In the sciences (as opposed to in mathematics) people are often a bit vague about exactly what assumptions they are making about how "well-behaved" things are.  The reason for this is that ultimately these theories are made to be put to the test, so why bother worrying about exactly which properties you're assuming when what you care about is functions coming up in real life which are probably going to satisfy all of your assumptions.This is particularly ubiquitous in physics where it is extremely common to make heuristic assumptions about well-behavior.Even in mathematics we do this sometimes.  When people say something is true for n sufficiently large, they often won't bother writing down exactly how large is sufficiently large as long as it's clear from context how to work it out.  Similarly, in an economics paper you could read through the argument and figure out exactly what assumptions they need, but it makes it easier to read to just say "well-behaved."	21

259	255	Let's group the terms as follows:Group $1$ : $\displaystyle\frac11\qquad$           ($1$ term)Group $2$ : $\displaystyle\frac12+\frac13\qquad$($2$ terms)Group $3$ : $\displaystyle\frac14+\frac15+\frac16+\frac17\qquad$($4$ terms)Group $4$ : $\displaystyle\frac18+\frac19+\cdots+\frac1{15}\qquad$   ($8$ terms)$\quad\vdots$In general, group $n$ contains $2^{n-1}$ terms.  But also, notice that the smallest element in group $n$ is larger than $\dfrac1{2^n}$.  For example all elements in group $2$ are larger than $\dfrac1{2^2}$.  So the sum of the terms in each group is larger than $2^{n-1} \cdot \dfrac1{2^n} =  \dfrac1{2}$.  Since there are infinitely many groups, and the sum in each group is larger than $\dfrac1{2}$, it follows that the total sum is infinite.  This proof is often attributed to Nicole Oresme.	116
260	250	There are true statements in arithmetic which are unprovable.  Even more remarkably there are explicit polynomial equations where it's unprovable whether or not they have integer solutions with ZFC! (We need ZFC + consistency of ZFC)	32
261	255	This is not as good an answer as AgCl's, nonetheless people may find it interesting.If you're used to calculus then you might notice that the sum $$1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\dots+\frac{1}{n}$$ is very close to the integral from $1$ to $n$ of $\frac{1}{x}$.  This definite integral is ln(n), so you should expect $1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\dots+\frac{1}{n}$ to grow like $\ln(n)$.Although this argument can be made rigorous, it's still unsatisfying because it depends on the fact that the derivative of $\ln(x)$ is $\frac{1}{x}$, which is probably harder than the original question.  Nonetheless it does illustrate a good general heuristic for quickly determining how sums behave if you already know calculus.	18

292	287	No, this is not a proof of your statement. If you look very closely, you will see that the hypotenuse of the triangles aren't straight. You can also verify this algebraically by calculating the internal angles of the triangle using trigonometry.The other way to demonstrate the non-straightness of the hypotenuse is in the fact that the red and blue triangles aren't similar, which can be seen by the difference in the ratios of their width and height. For the blue triangle, this is 2/5 and for the red triangle this is 3/8. As they are both right angled triangles, these ratios would be the same for similar triangles and the fact that they aren't means the interior angles are different. 	12
293	283	Simple answer: sometimes yes, sometimes no, it's usually stated (or implied by notation). From the Wikipedia article:  In mathematics, there are two  conventions for the set of natural  numbers: it is either the set of  positive integers  $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$  according to the traditional  definition; or the set of non-negative  integers $\{0, 1, 2,\dots\}$ according to a  definition first appearing in the  nineteenth century.Saying that, more often than not I've seen the natural numbers only representing the 'counting numbers' (i.e. excluding zero). This was the traditional historical definition, and makes more sense to me. Zero is in many ways the 'odd one out' - indeed, historically it was not discovered (described?) until some time after the natural numbers.	40
294	283	There are the two definitions, as you say. However the set of strictly positive numbers being the natural numbers is actually the older definition. Inclusion of $0$ in the natural numbers is a definition for them that first occurred in the 19th century. The Peano Axioms for natural numbers take $0$ to be one though, so if you are working with these axioms (and a lot of natural number theory does) then you take $0$ to be a natural number.	7
296	283	There is no "official rule", it depends from what you want to do with natural numbers. Originally they started from $1$ because $0$ was not given the status of number.Nowadays if you see $\mathbb{N}^+$ you may be assured we are talking about numbers from $1$ above; $\mathbb{N}$ is usually for numbers from $0$ above.[EDIT: the original definitions of Peano axioms, as found in Arithmetices principia: nova methodo, may be found at https://archive.org/details/arithmeticespri00peangoog : look at it.  ]	27
297	Simple numerical methods for calculating the digits of $\pi$	Are there any simple methods for calculating the digits of $\pi$?

299	120	actually 1 was considered a prime number until the beginning of 20th century. Unique factorization was a driving force beneath its changing of status, since it's formulation is quickier if 1 is not considered a prime; but I think that group theory was the other force. Indeed I prefer to describe numbers as primes, composites and unities, that is numbers whose inverse exists (so if we take the set of integer numbers Z, we have that 1 and -1 are unities and we still have unique factorization up to unities).We can always amend the defition of a prime number and say it is a number with exactly two divisors: in this way 1 is not a prime by definition :-)	29
300	198	when dealing with infinite sets, many propositions cannot be proved mithout using non-constructive proofs. Axiom of Choice (AC, in brief) or an equivalent proposition is required.

But few mathematicians would prefer not to do a lot of maths because AC is not allowed!	1
301	Why are $\Delta_1$ sentences of arithmetic called recursive?	The arithmetic hierarchy defines the $\Pi_1$ formulae of arithmetic to be formulae that are provably equivalent to a formula in prenex normal form that only has universal quantifiers, and $\Sigma_1$ if it is provably equivalent to a prenex normal form with only existential quantifiers.A formula is $\Delta_1$ if it is both $\Pi_1$ and $\Sigma_1.$  These formulae are often called recursive: why?	9
302	237	Representing a polygon by its edge path might not be the most useful, especially if you want to ask about inclusion for many points.  Consider triangulating the polygon, which is trivial for convex polygons, and not difficult to find O(n log(n)) for hairier cases.  Then determining whether the point is in the polygon reduces to whether it is in anyone of the triangles, which is easy.	1

But how can I prove or disprove that these two are valid homomorphisms?	8
304	283	I remember all of my courses at University using only positive integers (not including $0$) for the Natural Numbers. It's possible that they had come to an agreement amongst the Maths Faculty, but during at least two courses we generated the set of natural numbers in ways that wouldn't make sense if $0$ was included.One involved the cardinality of Sets of Sets, the other defined the natural numbers in terms of the number $1$ and addition only ($0$ and Negative Integers come into the picture later when you define an inverse to addition).As a result when teaching the difference between Integers and Natural Numbers I always define $0$ as an integer that isn't a Natural Number.	2

307	Prove that $(n-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{n}$ iff $n$ is prime	How can I show that $(n-1)!$ is congruent to $-1 \pmod{n}$ if and only if $n$ is prime?Thanks.	11
308	307	$$n\text{ is prime if }(n-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod n$$This direction is easy. If $n$ is composite, then there exists $k|n$ and $k\lt n$. So $k|(n-1)!$ and $k \equiv 1 \pmod n$. This means $k$ needs to divide $1$. So $n$ must be prime (or $1$, but we can eliminate this by substitution).$$(n-1)! \equiv -1\text{ if }n\text{ is prime}$$Wikipedia contains two proofs of this result known as Wilson's theorem. The first proof only uses basic abstract algebra and so should be understandable with a good knowledge of modular arithmetic. Just in case, I prove below that each element $1, 2, ... n-1$ has a unique inverse $\mod n$.They use the fact that integers $\mod p$ form a group and hence that each element $x$ not congruent $0$ has a multiplicative inverse (a number $y$ such that $xy \equiv 1 \mod n$.We show this as follows. Suppose $n \nmid x$, for $n$ prime. From the uniqueness of prime factorisations, $xn$ is the first product of $x$, after $0x$, divisible by $n$ (use prime factorisation theorem). If we look at the series $kn \mod n$, this cycles and must have cycle length $n$. Therefore, each element $x, 2x,... nx$ must be different modulo $n$, including one, $y$, with $xy \equiv 1 \mod n$. Furthermore, due to the cycle length being $n$, each only one of those elements will be an inverse. So every element has a unique inverse (although 1 and -1 are their own inverses).	18
309	If $A$ is a subobject of $B$, and $B$ a subobject of $A$, are they isomorphic?	In category theory, a subobject of $X$ is defined as an object $Y$ with a monomorphism, from $Y$ to $X$. If $A$ is a subobject of $B$, and $B$ a subobject of $A$, are they isomorphic? It is not true in general that having monomorphisms going both ways between two objects is sufficient for isomorphy, so it would seem the answer is no.I ask because I'm working through the exercises in Geroch's Mathematical Physics, and one of them asks you to prove that the relation "is a subobject of" is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric. But it can't be antisymmetric if I'm right...	14
310	303	If one has a homomorphism of two rings $R, S$, and $R~$ has an identity, then the identity must be mapped to an idempotent element of $S$, because the equation $x^2=x$ is preserved under homomorphisms.  Now $5$ is not an idempotent element in $\Bbb Z_{15}$, so the map generated by $1 \to 5$ is not a homomorphism.However, 10 is an idempotent element of $\Bbb Z_{15}$. In particular, the subring $T \subset \Bbb Z_{15}$ generated by 10 has unit 10.  Since it is annihilated by 3, and consequently by 18, there is a unital homomorphism $\Bbb Z_{18} \to T$ (i.e., mapping $1$ to $10$).  So your second map is a legitimate homomorphism of rings (composing with the injection $T \to \Bbb Z_{15}$).Basically, the point of this answer is to check that one of your maps preserves the relations of the two rings, while the other doesn't.	19
311	Higher Order Logics	I've read about about higher-order logics (i.e. those that build on first-order predicate logic) but am not too clear on their applications. While they are capable of expressing a greater range of proofs (though never all, by Godel's Incompleteness theorem), they are often said to be less "well-behaved". Mathematicians generally seem to stay clear of such logics when possible, yet they are certainly necessary for prooving some more complicated concepts/theorems, as I understand. (For example, it seems the reals can only be constructed using at least 2nd order logic.) Why is this, what makes them less well-behaved or less useful with respect to logic/proof theory/other fields?	7
312	301	If a formula $\phi(x_1, ... x_n)$ is in both $\Sigma_1, \Pi_1$, then one can define a Turing machine to determine whether it is true or false. Namely, in parallel, search for a collection of parameters that makes true the existential formula, and search for a collection of formulas that makes false the universal formula. If the first happens, return true; if the second happens, return false.  One of these must exist, so the Turing machine always halts.(The set of $x_1,...x_n$ such that $\phi(x_1, ... , x_n)$ is valid if $\phi$ belongs to  $\Sigma_1$ is, by contrast, is only recursively enumerable.)By contrast, since the action of any Turing machine is simulable by existential formulas in first-order logic (i.e. there exists a number $k$ such that $M$ halts in $k$ steps), any language which is recursively enumerable can be expressed by existential formulas. Any language whose complement is recursively enumerable can similarly be expressed by universal formulas (by the analog of deMorgan's laws). So any recursive language (i.e., one which is both recursively enumerable and whose complement is r.e.), can be expressed in both ways.	8
313	311	Second-order logic does not satisfy the completeness and compactness theorems. Here is a proof that the compactness theorem fails (which itself implies that the completeness theorem fails, because completeness implies compactness).  Namely, there is a second-order way (call it $F$) of expressing that a set is finite: every injective function on the set is surjective. This means that if $P$ is a relation on the product set $S \times S$ such that $P$ satisfies the conditions to be a function, and $P(x,y), P(z,y)$ imply $x=z$, then for all $w$ there is $q$ with $P(w,q)$. This statement is quantified over $P$ as well as the variables $x,y,z,w,q$ so is second-order and clearly expresses finiteness.However, we also have the statement $T_n$ "there exist distinct $x_0, \dots x_n$ in the set," which is even first order, and states that the set has cardinality at least $n$.So the conjunction of $F$ and any finite collection of the $T_n$ is satisfiable, but all of them together cannot be satisfied.	2

315	297	One of the simplest is the series for arctangent:$$\tan^{-1}x = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^7}{7} + \cdots$$$\pi/4 = \tan^{-1} 1$, but that converges slowly.You can use the addition formula for the tangent $(\tan (a+b) = (\tan a + \tan b) / (1 - \tan a \tan b))$ to break down $\pi/4$  to the sum of two angles and repeat; this can be used to come up with values for the arctangent that are smaller than 1 and therefore converge faster.exercise for the reader: show that $\pi/4 = 2 \tan^{-1} 2/11 + 3 \tan^{-1} 1/7$This then means that  $\pi = 8 \tan^{-1} 2/11 + 12 \tan^{-1} 1/7$Use the arctangent formula with only a few terms and you will have pi to quite a few decimal places. (3 terms yields 3.14160, 4 terms yields 3.1415924, 5 terms yields 3.1415926592)	16
316	Why is $\int\limits_0^1 (1-x^7)^{1/5} - (1-x^5)^{1/7} dx=0$?	When I tried to approximate $$\int_{0}^{1} (1-x^7)^{1/5}-(1-x^5)^{1/7}\ dx$$ I kept getting answers that were really close to $0$, so I think it might be true. But why? When I ask Mathematica, I get a bunch of symbols I don't understand! 	19
319	8	A lot of people have mentioned Binet's formula.  But I suspect this is not the most practical way to compute the nth Fibonacci number for large n, because it requires either having a very accurate value of $\sqrt{5}$ and carrying around lots of decimal places (if you want to do floating-point arithmetic) or expanding large powers of $1+\sqrt{5}$ using the binomial formula.  The latter comes out to writing the Fibonacci number as a sum of binomial coefficients.The following formulas hold, though:$$F(2n-1) = F(n)^2 + F(n-1)^2$$$$F(2n) = (2F(n-1) + F(n)) \times F(n)$$which you can find derivations of in the Wikipedia article on Fibonacci numbers.  This lets you find $F(k)$, for any $k$ even or odd, in terms of two Fibonacci numbers with approximately half the index.  The result is faster than Binet's formula.	24
320	307	[NOTE: it seems that there is some difference between preview and actual output, so instead if using (mod p) I stick with (p)]to show that $(p-1)! \equiv -1 (p)$ without explicitly use group theory, maybe the simplest path is: (the following assumes $p$ is odd, but if $p=2$ then the result is immediate)given $n \ne 0$, all values $n, 2n, ... (p-1)$ $n$ are different mod $p$. Otherwise, if $hn \equiv kn (p)$ then $(h-k)n \equiv 0 (p)$ against the hypothesis that $p$ is prime.this means that each $n$ has an inverse mod $p$, that is for each $n$ there is a $m$ such that $mn \equiv 1 (p)$.the equation $x^2\equiv 1 (p)$ may be written as $(x+1)(x-1) \equiv 0 (p)$; therefore its only solutions are $x \equiv 1 (p)$ and $x \equiv -1 (p)$. For each other number $n$, an inverse $m$ must exist (because of the pigeonhole principle) but $m \neq n$.we are nearly done. Let's couple every number from $2$ to $p-2$ with its own inverse. Their product is $1 (p)$, so they don't count in the overall total. $1$ does not count either; it remains just $p-1$, that is $-1 (p)$ as requested.	4
321	303	I will quote Wikipedia on the definition of a ring homomorphism.  More precisely, if R and S are rings,  then a ring homomorphism is a function  f : R → S such that1    f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) for all a and b in R  f(ab) = f(a) f(b) for all a and b in R  f(1) = 1  The last requirement is being relaxed. We can then sub in our f, in this case f(a1)=5a or f(a1)=10a and see if these relations hold. Given that these are small, finite and well understood groups, the problem is easy to solve from here.	-2

324	Unital homomorphism	What is a unital homomorphism? Why are they important?	7
325	311	Unfortunately the term is ambiguous: there two kinds of semantics of higher-order languages, and only one is problematic.  Consider the language of second-order arithmetic, where there are quantifiers over both natural numbers and sets of natural numbers.First is what Quine called "set-theory in sheep's clothing": this is where  quantification over sets of natural numbers is defined to be over all the sets of number that can be posited.  It's the theory we use when we prove that there can be only one complete, totally ordered field.  It isn't really a logic, there's no complete notion of proof formalisation for it.  Wikipedia calls this "standard semantics"; I'm not sure if there is an authority for this.Then there's Henkin semantics, which uses the rule analogous to the lambda-calculus to define a  semantics for second-order quantifiers.  This can be seen as still in the realm of first-order logic, in that sense that the second-order system can be translated into a first-order system conserving provability.  This is how second-order arithmetic is defined.All the theorems of the Henkin semantics will be "theorems" in the first.	4
326	Calculating the probability of two dice getting at least a $1$ or a $5$	So you have $2$ dice and you want to get at least a $1$ or a $5$ (on the dice not added).  How do you go about calculating the answer for this question.This question comes from the game farkle.	2
327	309	I don't think this can be true in general. What if we just take the category consisting of two objects $A$, $B$ and take morphisms $f:A\to B$, $g:B\to A$ with no relations between the morphisms, but forcing associativity. Then certainly $f$ and $g$ are monomorphisms but $A$ and $B$ are not isomorphic (since there are no relations between the morphisms).	12
328	326	Go backwards: Calculate the probability that neither of them shows a 1 or 5. That means both show a 2, 3, 4, or 6. Thats $(4/6)^2$.Hence the probability that at least one shows a 1 or 5 is $1-(2/3)^2=5/9$.	11

330	324	A unital homomorphism between rings R and S is a ring homomorphism that sends the identity element of R to the identity element of S.Homomorphisms (between objects in any algebraic category like groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.) preserve the algebraic structure, and if you want a map between rings with an identity element, it is natural to require this to preserve this element (since it satisfies unique properties).	1
331	329	I would still stick with Hardy and Wright, even if it is quite old.	59
332	324	A lot of results about rings just won't work otherwise: for instance, a unital homomorphism of rings sends units to units.  A nonunital homomorphism doesn't have to do that.  Nonunital homomorphisms can be very degenerate, e.g. the zero homomorphism.Another reason you want homomorphisms to preserve the unit is that this is how you get a map $\operatorname{Spec S} \to \operatorname{Spec} R$ from a ring-homomorphism $R \to S$.  	6

336	Why are $3D$ transformation matrices $4 \times 4$ instead of $3 \times 3$?	Background: Many (if not all) of the transformation matrices used in $3D$ computer graphics are $4\times 4$, including the three values for $x$, $y$ and $z$, plus an additional term which usually has a value of $1$.Given the extra computing effort required to multiply $4\times 4$ matrices instead of $3\times 3$ matrices, there must be a substantial benefit to including that extra fourth term, even though $3\times 3$ matrices should (?) be sufficient to describe points and transformations in 3D space.Question: Why is the inclusion of a fourth term beneficial? I can guess that it makes the computations easier in some manner, but I would really like to know why that is the case.	28
337	329	A concise introduction to the theory of numbers by Alan Baker (1970 Fields medalist) covers a lot of ground in less than 100 pages, and does so in a fluid way that never feels rushed. I love this little book.	21
338	336	  even though 3x3 matrices should (?) be sufficient to describe points and transformations in 3D space.No, they aren't enough! Suppose you represent points in space using 3D vectors. You can transform these using 3x3 matrices. But if you examine the definition of matrix multiplication you should see immediately that multiplying a zero 3D vector by a 3x3 matrix gives you another zero vector. So simply multiplying by a 3x3 matrix can never move the origin. But translations and rotations do need to move the origin. So 3x3 matrices are not enough.I haven't tried to explain exactly how 4x4 matrices are used. But I hope I've convinced you that 3x3 matrices aren't up to the task and that something more is needed.	24
339	275	John Derbyshire's Prime Obsession is about Riemann's hypothesis. One of the stated goals of the author is to explain what "all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part one-half" means to readers who have no background in calculus. Odd-numbered chapters tell the story of how Riemann came to his hypothesis, and even-numbered chapters are more mathematical in nature.	10
340	336	To follow up user80's answer, you want to get transformations of the form v --> Av + b, where A is a 3 by 3 matrix (the linear part of transformation) and b is a 3-vector.  We can encode this transformation in a 4 x 4 matrix by putting A in the top left with three 0's below it and making the last column be (b,1).  Multiplying the 4-vector (v,1) with this matrix will give you (Av + b, 1).	10
342	329	I like Niven and Zuckerman, Introduction to the Theory of Numbers.	38
343	336	I'm going to copy my answer from Stack Overflow, which also shows why 4-component vectors (and hence 4×4 matrices) are used instead of 3-component ones.In most 3D graphics a point is represented by a 4-component vector (x, y, z, w), where w = 1. Usual operations applied on a point include translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, skewing and combination of these. These transformations can be represented by a mathematical object called "matrix". A matrix applies on a vector like this:[ a b c tx ] [ x ]   [ a*x + b*y + c*z + tx*w ]| d e f ty | | y | = | d*x + e*y + f*z + ty*w || g h i tz | | z |   | g*x + h*y + i*z + tz*w |[ p q r s  ] [ w ]   [ p*x + q*y + r*z +  s*w ]For example, scaling is represented as[ 2 . . . ] [ x ]   [ 2x ]| . 2 . . | | y | = | 2y || . . 2 . | | z |   | 2z |[ . . . 1 ] [ 1 ]   [ 1  ]and translation as[ 1 . . dx ] [ x ]   [ x + dx ]| . 1 . dy | | y | = | y + dy || . . 1 dz | | z |   | z + dz |[ . . . 1  ] [ 1 ]   [   1    ]One of the reason for the 4th component is to make a translation representable by a matrix.The advantage of using a matrix is that multiple transformations can be combined into one via matrix multiplication.Now, if the purpose is simply to bring translation on the table, then I'd say (x, y, z, 1) instead of (x, y, z, w) and make the last row of the matrix always [0 0 0 1], as done usually for 2D graphics. In fact, the 4-component vector will be mapped back to the normal 3-vector vector via this formula:[ x(3D) ]   [ x / w ]| y(3D) ] = | y / w |[ z(3D) ]   [ z / w ]This is called homogeneous coordinates. Allowing this makes the perspective projection expressible with a matrix too, which can again combine with all other transformations.For example, since objects farther away should be smaller on screen, we transform the 3D coordinates into 2D using formulax(2D) = x(3D) / (10 * z(3D))y(2D) = y(3D) / (10 * z(3D))Now if we apply the projection matrix[ 1 . .  . ] [ x ]   [  x   ]| . 1 .  . | | y | = |  y   || . . 1  . | | z |   |  z   |[ . . 10 . ] [ 1 ]   [ 10*z ]then the real 3D coordinates would becomex(3D) := x/w = x/10zy(3D) := y/w = y/10zz(3D) := z/w = 0.1so we just need to chop the z-coordinate out to project to 2D.	32
344	329	Serre's "A course in Arithmetic" is pretty phenomenal.	40
345	316	Note that if$$ y = \left(1 - x^7\right)^{1/5} $$then $$ \left(1 - y^5\right)^{1/7} = x $$This means $(1-x^7)^{1/5}$ is the inverse function of $(1-x^5)^{1/7}$. In the graph, one will be the same as the other when reflected along the diagonal line y = x.Also, both functions share the same range [0, 1] and domain [0, 1] andmonotonically decreasing,Therefore, the area under the graph in [0, 1] will be the same for both functions:$$ \int_0^1 \left(1-x^7\right)^{1/5} dx = \int_0^1 \left(1-y^5\right)^{1/7} dy $$Grouping the two integrals yield the equation in the title.	46
346	250	Similar to the Monty Hall problem, but trickier: at the latest Gathering 4 Gardner, Gary Foshee asked   I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?We are assuming that births are equally distributed during the week, that every child is a boy or girl with probability 1/2, and that there is no dependence relation between sex and day of birth.His Answer: 13/27. This was in the news a lot recently, see for instance BBC News.  (Later analysis showed the answer depends on why the parent said that.)	20
347	250	You have two identical pieces of paper with the same picture printed on them. You put one flat on a table and the other one you crumple up (without tearing it) and place it on top of the first one. Brouwer's fixed point theorem states that there is some point in the picture on the crumpled-up page that is directly above the same point on the bottom page. It doesn't matter how you place the pages, or how you deform the top one.	60
348	57	It's not clear what the question is asking. Is it asking for logical relations among the properties? e.g. a relation that is transitive and symmetric MUST be reflexive (unless the relation holds between no two objects).Or is it asking for mathematical relations that have these properties? ">" is transitive, asymmetric and total or complete (for all distinct x,y either xRy or yRx). It is a strict total order. "greater or equal" is transitive, complete, symmetric, reflexive. This is a weak total order."x is a subset of y" is reflexive and antisymmetric but not necessarily transitive, symmetric (although it can be either of those things if you restrict yourself to the right sort of sets). "x is a proper subset of y" is asymmetric and irreflexive (for all x, it is not the case that xRx), and can be transitive if you restrict yourself to the right sort of sets.Note that in both these cases, one can define one of each pair of relations in terms of the other (plus a notion of identity or non-identity).In logic the notion of "x entails y" is transitive, reflexive.The relation "x has the same integer part as y" over the real numbers is transitive, reflexive, symmetric. This is called an equivalence relation.	2

351	135	If $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers, then $a^b$ is the number of ways you can make a sequence of length $b$ where each element in the sequence is chosen from a set of size $a$. You're allowed replacements. For example $2^3$ is the number of 3 digit sequences where each digit is zero or $1$: $000, 001, 010, \ldots, 111.$There is precisely one way to make a zero length sequence: one. So you'd expect $0^0=1$.	16
352	57	I think you're thinking about this in the wrong way. Properties don't "work", properties are things that are true for the given relation.For instance, you say that the a relation has the reflexive property if it satisfies the condition that all elements are related to themselves. Similarly, it has the symmetric property if for all a and b, if a is related to b then b is related to a.You could simply say that "∀a : a R a" each time, but because this is something that happens often, this particular property has been given a name, i.e. reflexivity.Certain types of specific relations are also given names. For instance, a partial order is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive, and equivalence relations are reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Again, these are just names that aren't strictly needed, but they make it more convenient talking about these kinds of things.	3
353	297	Some of the easiest algorithms to use are the spigot algorithms. They allow you to jump rapidly to the nth digit without computing the n-1 digits before. The catch is that they only really work in binary. Here are some implementations in Python. You can see how short they are.	14

362	History of the Concept of a Ring	I am vaguely familiar with the broad strokes of the development of group theory, first when ideas of geometric symmetries were studied in concrete settings without the abstract notion of a group available, and later as it was formalized by Cayley, Lagrange, etc (and later, infinite groups being well-developed). In any case, it's intuitively easy for me to imagine that there was substantial lay, scientific, and artistic interest in several of the concepts well-encoded by a theory of groups.I know a few of the corresponding names for who developed the abstract formulation of rings initially (Wedderburn etc.), but I'm less aware of the ideas and problems that might have given rise to interest in ring structures. Of course, now they're terribly useful in lots of math, and $\mathbb{Z}$ is a natural model for elementary properties of commutative rings, and I'll wager number theorists had an interest in developing the concept. And if I wanted noncommutative models, matrices are a good place to start looking. But I'm not even familiar with what the state of knowledge and formalization of things like matrices/linear operators was at the time rings were developed, so maybe these aren't actually good examples for how rings might have been motivated. Can anyone outline or point me to some basics on the history of the development of basic algebraic structures besides groups? 	45
363	362	Edit: Bill Dubuque has pointed out that much of this answer (specifically, the part about FLT) is essentially a mathematical urban legend, albeit a pervasive one. I cannot delete an accepted answer, so here is a link to an answer of his on MO explaining it.Here is also a link to a related question.There's some of the history here in Bourbaki's Commutative Algebra, in the appendix.  Basically, a fair bit of ring theory was developed for algebraic number theory.  This in turn was because people were trying to prove Fermat's last theorem. Why's this? Let $p$ be a prime. Then the equation $x^p + y^p = z^p$ can be written as $\prod (x+\zeta_p^iy) = z^p$ for $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$th root of unity.  All these quantities are elements of the ring $Z[\zeta_p]$.  So if $p>3$ and there is unique factorization in the ring $Z[\zeta_p]$, it isn't terribly hard to show that this is impossible at least in the basic case where $p $ does not divide $xyz$ (and can be found, for instance, in Borevich-Shafarevich's book on number theory).Lame actually thought he had a proof of FLT via this argument. But he was wrong: these rings generally don't admit unique factorization.  So, it became a problem to study these "generalized integers" $Z[\zeta_p]$, which of course are basic examples of rings.  It wasn't until Dedekind that the right notion of unique factorization -- namely, factorization of ideals -- was found. In fact, the case of FLT I just mentioned generalizes to the case where $p$ does not divide the class number of $Z[\zeta_p]$ (the class number is the invariant that measures how far it is from being a UFD).  And, according to this article, Dedekind was the first to define a ring.The article I linked to, incidentally, has a fair bit of additional interesting history.	12

367	365	Here's my best shot at the sort of explanation you're asking for, although it's not nearly as clear as the $2 \times n$ case.  The negative sign makes combinatorial proofs difficult, so let's rearrange this as:$$f(n) + f(n-2) = 4f(n-1)$$Then you want to show that the number of $n$-tilings, plus the number of $(n-2)$-tilings, is four times the number of $(n-1)$-tilings. (An "n-tiling" is a tiling of a $3 \times 2n$ rectangle by dominoes.)In bijective terms, then, we want a bijection between the set of $n$-tilings and $(n-2)$-tilings and the set of $(n-1)$-tilings, where the $(n-1)$-tilings are each tagged with the number $1, 2, 3,$ or $4$.Given an $(n-1)$-tiling, there are three "obvious" ways to obtain an $n$-tiling from it, namely by adding one of the three $1$-tilings on the right end.  These generate tilings which have a vertical line passing all the way through,  two units from the right end; call these "faulted" tilings, and those which don't have a vertical line in that position "faultless".So it suffices to show that the number of faultless $n$-tilings, plus the number of $(n-2)$-tilings, is the number of $(n-1)$-tilings.  It's easy to see that the number of faultless $n$-tilings is $2g(n-2)$; a faultless tilings must have a horizontal domino covering the second and third squares from the right in some row, and this assumption forces the placement of some other dominoes.  So we need $2g(n-2) + f(n-2) = f(n-1)$.  Shifting the indices, we need $2g(n-1) + f(n-1) = f(n)$, which you have already said is true.	10

372	297	There is also the option of approximating $\pi$ using Monte Carlo integration. The idea is this: If we agree that the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$, for simplicity we build a circle of area $\pi$ by setting $r=1$.  Placing this circle wholly inside of another region of known area, preferably by inscribing it in a square of side length 2, then we have a ratio of the circle's area to the total area of the square  (in this example that ratio is $\frac{\pi}{4}$).  The Monte Carlo method works by approximating areas based on the ratio of the number of sample points lying within our region of interest and the total number of sample points we choose to try.  If we spread a uniformly distributed sequence of $N$ points over our square of area 4, and call the number of points that land inside of the inscribed circle $p$, then we can say $\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{p}{N}$.  My implementation of this in Matlab requires tens of thousands of test points to achieve 3.14159xxxx, but I have not tried it for low-discrepancy sequences, or any other uniformly distributed point sets.    	6

375	Are $x \cdot 0 = 0$, $x \cdot 1 = x$, and $-(-x) = x$ axioms?	Context: Rings.  Are $x \cdot 0 = 0$ and $x \cdot 1 = x$ and $-(-x) = x$ axioms?Arguably three questions in one, but since they all are properties of the multiplication, I'll try my luck...	9
376	375	I will assume this is in the context of rings (e.g., real numbers, integers, etc).  In this case, the axiom defining $0$ is that $x + 0 = x$ for all $x$.  $x*0 = 0$ is a result of this since we have $x*0 = x*(0+0) = x*0 + x*0$ which implies $x*0 = 0$ (canceling one of the $x*0$'s).I am guessing that for the second one you mean $x*1 = x$.  This is a definition (axiom).The third one is a consequence of the definition of $-x$ being the element such that $x + (-x) = 0$.  For then we have $(-x) + x$ is also zero so that $x$ is the negative of $-x$.	15
377	370	Lang's Algebra contains a lot of introductory material on categories, which is really nice since it's done with constant motivation from algebra (e.g. coproducts are introduced right before the free product of groups is discussed). 	27
378	350	When it comes to textbooks, the Kenneth Rosen text Discrete Mathematics and its Applications is highly recommended. I was first introduced to it at my university, but I've seen it cited in several places.	1
379	375	The question is more profound than is initially seems, and is really about algebraic structures. The first question you have to ask yourself is where you're working:In general, addition and multiplication are defined on a structure, which in this case  is a set (basically a collection of "things") with two operators we call addition (marked $+$) and multiplication (marked $\cdot$ or $\times$ or $\ast$ or whatever). If this structure holds some properties, which are sometimes called axioms, then it is called a unit ring. The properties are:The set is closed under the operator $+$. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $R$, then $a+b$ is also in $R$.The set has a member which we mark as $0$. It has the properties that for every $a$ in $R$, $a+0 = 0$ and $0+a = 0$.The operation $+$ is commutative: $a+b = b+a$.The operation $+$ is associative: $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$.Every member has an additive inverse: for every $a$ in $R$ there is some $b$ in $R$ such that $a+b = 0$ (we mark $b$ as $-a$).The set is closed under the operator $*$. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $R$, then $a*b$ is also in $R$.The set has a member which we mark as $1$. It has the properties that for every $a$ in $R$, $a*1 = a$ and $1*a = a$.The operation $*$ is associative: $(a*b) * c = a * (b*c)$.Multiplication is distributive over addition: $a * (b+c) = a*b + a*c$ and $(a+b) * c = a*b + a*c$. While this is a long list, and introduces the operator $+$ which is not even explicitly mentioned in the question, these properties are quite natural. For example, the integers $\{ \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$ we all know and love indeed form a ring. The real numbers also form a ring  (in fact they form a field, which means they hold even more properties).In regard to your question, the identity $x * 1 = x$ (I assume that's what you meant) is in fact an axiom - it is axiom 7. However, the other two identities are results of the other axioms.First identity: We use axioms 2 and 9 to get  $0 * x = (0+0) * x = 0*x + 0*x$  and then by adding $-(0*x)$ (the additive inverse of $0*x$, from axiom 5) to both sides,  $0 = 0*x$.Second identity: As stated in axiom 5, $-(-x)$ is just a notation used which means "the additive inverse of $-x$". To show that $-(-x) = x$ we need to show that $x$ is in fact the additive inverse of $-x$, or in other words that $x + -x = 0$ and $-x + x = 0$. But that's just what axiom 5 says, so we're done.Last point: You might be wondering why did we have to go and introduce addition to answer a question about multiplication? Well, it so happens that without addition the other two identities are simply not true. For example, if we look at the positive integers $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ with only multiplication, then there is no $0$ there! Simply put, this is because the positive integers do not form a ring.	11

381	Applications of the Fibonacci sequence	The Fibonacci sequence is very well known, and is often explained with a story about how many rabbits there are after $n$ generations if they each produce a new pair every generation. Is there any other reason you would care about the Fibonacci sequence?	23
382	381	Yep, the solution by Matiyasevich to Hilbert's tenth problem relies heavily on showing exponentiation is Diophantine.  In other words, the relation R given by $R(x,y,z)$ if and only if $x^y = z$ can be expressed by a polynomial equation $T(x,y,z,w)=0$, such that $R(x,y,z)$ holds if and only if $T(x,y,z,w)=0$ has a solution with $w$ integral.  This is a very difficult and technical result, as well as rather counterintuitive. Recall that the Fibonacci numbers grow essentially exponentially. One of the lemmas in showing that exponentiation is Diophantine is to show that the Fibonacci sequence (and its variants) are Diophantine.  See the book by Matiyasevich on Hilbert's 10th problem.	13
383	381	They are sometimes used or occur in financial applications, e.g. Elliot Wave Theory.  This seems more like magic than math to me, but I am not a trader.	2
384	381	It isn't exactly an application as such, but the upper bound of the size of a subtree in a Fibonacci heap whose root is a node with degree $k$ is $F_{k+2}$ where $F_n$ is the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number.	7
385	375	Answering what you asked, the question is poorly formed because you didn't specify the theory you are talking about. To do that, well, you must define symbols, deduction rules... and axioms.Answering what you probably meant to ask, no. Those are properties that - and × have in the Z set, not axioms. They can be deduced from the operations themselves.	-1

387	Sum of reciprocals of numbers with certain terms omitted	I know that the harmonic series $1 + \frac12 + \frac13 + \frac14 + \cdots$ diverges. I also know that the sum of the inverse of prime numbers $\frac12 + \frac13 + \frac15 + \frac17 + \frac1{11} + \cdots$ diverges too, even if really slowly since it's $O(\log \log n)$.But I think I read that if we consider the numbers whose decimal representation does not have a certain digit (say, 7) and sum the inverse of these numbers, the sum is finite (usually between 19 and 20, it depends from the missing digit). Does anybody know the result, and some way to prove that the sum is finite?	27
388	387	EDIT: This might be what you're looking for. Found it from looking at the source below. They're called Kempner series.An article here (and cited below) says that one Dr. Kempner proved in 1914 that the series 1+ 1/2 + 1/3 + ..., with any term that has a 9 in the denominator removed, is convergent (though he doesn't say what it converges to in the introductory paragraph). The article goes on to generalize the result.

392	Intuitive understanding of the derivatives of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$	One of the first things ever taught in a differential calculus class:The derivative of $\sin x$ is $\cos x$.The derivative of $\cos x$ is $-\sin x$.This leads to a rather neat (and convenient?) chain of derivatives:sin(x)cos(x)-sin(x)-cos(x)sin(x)...An analysis of the shape of their graphs confirms some points; for example, when $\sin x$ is at a maximum, $\cos x$ is zero and moving downwards; when $\cos x$  is at a maximum, $\sin x$ is zero and moving upwards.  But these "matching points" only work for multiples of $\pi/4$.Let us move back towards the original definition(s) of sine and cosine:At the most basic level, $\sin x$ is defined as -- for a right triangle with internal angle $x$ -- the length of the side opposite of the angle divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle.To generalize this to the domain of all real numbers, $\sin x$ was then defined as the Y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle that is an angle $x$ from the positive X-axis.The definition of $\cos x$ was then made the same way, but with adj/hyp and the X-coordinate, as we all know.Is there anything about this basic definition that allows someone to look at these definitions, alone, and think, "Hey, the derivative of the sine function with respect to angle is the cosine function!"That is, from the unit circle definition alone.  Or, even more amazingly, the right triangle definition alone.  Ignoring graphical analysis of their plot.In essence, I am asking, essentially, "Intuitively why is the derivative of the sine the cosine?"	34
393	392	This isn't exactly what you asked, but look at the Taylor series for the polynomials:$$ \sin x = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots\text{ for all } x\!$$$$\cos x = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots\text{ for all } x\! $$The relationships between the derivatives are clear from this.	2
394	387	It is not very surprising that the sum is finite, since numbers without a 7 (or any other digit) get rarer and rarer as the number of digits increases.Here's a proof.Let $S$ be the harmonic series with all terms whose denominator contains the digit $k$ removed. We can write $S =S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + \ldots$, where $S_i$ is the sum of all terms whose denominator contains exactly $i$ digits, all different from $k$.Now, the number of $i$-digit numbers that do not contain the digit $k$ is $8\cdot9^{i-1}$ (there are $8$ choices for the first digit, excluding $0$ and $k$, and $9$ choices for the other digits). [Well, if $k=0$ there are $9$ choices for the first digit, but the proof still works.] So there are $8\cdot9^{i-1}$ numbers in the sum $S_i$.Now each number in $S_i$ is of the form $\frac1a$, where $a$ is an $i$-digit number. So $a \geq 10^{i-1}$, which implies $\frac1a \leq \frac1{10^{i-1}}$.Therefore $S_i \leq 8\cdot\dfrac{9^{i-1} }{10^{i-1}} = 8\cdot\left(\frac9{10}\right)^{i-1}$.So $S= \sum S_i \leq \sum 8\cdot\left(\frac9{10}\right)^{i-1}$which is a  geometric series of ratio $\frac9{10} < 1$, which converges. Since $S$ is a positive series bounded above by a converging series, $S$ converges. 	32
395	392	As a Physics Major, I would like to propose an answer that comes from my understanding of seeing sine and cosine in the real world.In doing this, I will examine uniform circular motion.Because of the point-on-a-unit-circle definition of sine and cosine, we can say that:r(t) = < cos(t), sin(t) >Is a proper parametric function to describe a point moving along the unit circle.Let us consider what the first derivate, in a physical context, should be.  The first derivative of position should represent, ideally, the velocity of the point.In a physical context, we would expect the velocity to be the line tangent to the direction of motion at a given time t.  Following from this, it would be tangent to the circle at angle t.  Also, because the angular velocity is constant, the magnitude of the velocity should be constant as well.r'(t)     = < -sin(t), cos(t) >|r'(t)|^2 = (-sin(t))^2 + cos(t)^2|r'(t)|^2 = sin(t)^2 + cos(t)^2|r'(t)|^2 = 1|r'(t)|   = 1As expected, the velocity is constant, so the derivatives of sine and cosine are behaving as they should.We can also think about what the direction of the velocity would be, as well, compared to the position vector.I'm not sure if this is "cheating" by the bounds of the question, but by visualizing the graph we can see that the velocity, by nature of being tangent to the circle, must be perpendicular to the position vector.If this is true, then position * velocity = 0 (dot product).                              r(t) * r'(t) = 0  < cos(t), sin(t) > * < -sin(t), cos(t) > = 0( cos(t) * -sin(t) ) + ( sin(t) * cos(t) ) = 0              -sin(t)cos(t) + sin(t)cos(t) = 0                                         0 = 0Life is good.  If we assume that the definition of cos(t) is -sin(t) and that the definition of sin(t) is cos(t), we find physical behavior exactly like expected: a constant velocity that is always perpendicular to the position vector.We can take this further and look at the acceleration.  In Physics, we would call this the restoring force.  In a circle, what acceleration would have to exist in order to keep a point moving in a circle?More specifically, in what direction would this acceleration have to be?It takes little thought to arrive at the idea that acceleration would have to be center-seeking, and pointing towards the center.  So, if we can find that acceleration is in the opposite direction as the position vector, the we can be almost certain about the derivatives of sine and cosine.  That is, their internal angle should be pi.                            r(t) * r''(t) = |r(t)| * |r''(t)| * cos(pi)                            r(t) * r''(t) = |r(t)| * |r''(t)| * -1< cos(t), sin(t) > * < -cos(t), -sin(t) > = |<cos(t),sin(t)>| * |<-cos(t),-sin(t)>| * -1                    -cos(t)^2 + -sin(t)^2 = 1 * 1 * -1               -1 * (cos(t)^2 + sin(t)^2) = -1                                   -1 * 1 = -1                                       -1 = -1	9
396	381	Suppose you're writing a computer program to search a sorted array for a particular value. Usually the best method to use is a binary search. But binary search assumes it's the same cost to read from anywhere in the array. If it costs something to move from one array element to another, and the cost is proportional to how many array elements you need to skip over to get from one element you read to the next, then Fibonacci search works better. This can apply to situations like searching through arrays that don't fit entirely in your computer's cache so it's generally cheaper to read nearby elements that distant ones.	19
397	392	I don't think you can get an intuitive feel for the derivatives without looking at the plots personally. When you consider that a derivative is a rate of change, you need to be looking at a function that is varying, which implies you are looking at the plot/graph of the function. When you further consider that a derivative (by definition of it being a rate of change) is a gradient function, the intuitive answer is that cos is the gradient function of sin, and -sin is the gradient function of cos (and so on). So if you calculate the gradient of the sin curve at any point, the value you get will be the cosine value for that point.	1
398	What is larger -- the set of all positive even numbers, or the set of all positive integers?	We will call the set of all positive even numbers E and the set of all positive integers N.At first glance, it seems obvious that E is smaller than N, because for E is basically N with half of its terms taken out.  The size of E is the size of N divided by two.You could see this as, for every item in E, two items in N could be matched (the item x and x-1).  This implies that N is twice as large as EOn second glance though, it seems less obvious.  Each item in N could be mapped with one item in E (the item x*2).Which is larger, then?  Or are they both equal in size?  Why?(My background in Set theory is quite extremely scant)	10
399	398	They are both the same size, the size being 'countable infinity' or 'aleph-null'. The reasoning behind it is exactly that which you have already identified - you can assign each item in E to a single value in N. This is true for the Natural numbers, the Integers, the Rationals but not the Reals (see the Diagonal Slash argument for details on this result).-- Added explanation from comment --The first reasoning is invalid because the cardinality of infinite sets doesn't follow 'normal' multiplication rules. If you multiply a set with cardinality of aleph-0 by 2, you still have aleph-0. The same is true if you divide it, add to it, subtract from it by any finite amount. 	6
400	398	  Each item in N could be mapped with one item in E  (the item x*2).Yes. Both sets have cardinality aleph-0.	1
401	398	The word 'size' doesn't have a intuitive meaning for set of infinite items. Mathematicians defined cardinality by one-to-one correspondence(bijection), and it's generally what it means by 'size'. If there exist a bijection between A and B, then the two sets have the same cardinality. You have shown the existence of a bijection, therefore E and N have the same cardinality.You might mean the 'density' of N is twice as large as E. density of A(a subset of natural number) is limit of |{a<=n|a\in A}|/n as n goes to infinity.	7
402	275	As an undergrad, I read a fair number of pop math books. The best by far was Ash and Gross' "Fearless Symmetry". This book is very beautiful. It sustains a nice level of rigor while being approachable by those who aren't professionals. Additionally, it weaves the tale of one of the most beautiful recent stories in mathematics. Everyone I know of who have read the book have found it wonderful.	4
403	392	This interesting pattern of derivatives involving sine and cosine is related to the fact that e^x is its own derivative and that e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x) (Euler's Formula).These two facts are in some sense the math hiding behind Justin L's more physical explanation, which you might well find more intuitive.  	8
404	392	One of the main ways that sine and cosine come up is as the fundamental solutions to the differential equation $y'' = -y$, known as the wave equation. Why is this an important differential equation?  Well, interpreting it using Newton's second law it says "the force is proportional and opposite to the position." For example, this is what happens with a spring!Now that's a 2nd degree equation, so it has a 2-dimensional space of solutions. How to pick a nice basis for that space? Well, one way would be to pick $f$ and $g$ such that $f' = i f$ and $g' = -i g$. However, that involves too many imaginary numbers, so another option is $f' = -g$, and $g' = f$.Thus if you're trying to find two functions which explain oscillatory motion you're naturally lead to picking functions that have $f' = g$, $g' = -f$, etc.(On the other hand it's totally unclear from this point of view why Sine and Cosine should have anything to do with triangles...)	5
405	Simple explanation of a monad	I have been learning some functional programming recently and I so I have come across monads. I understand what they are in programming terms, but I would like to understand what they are mathematically. Can anyone explain what a monad is using as little category theory as possible?	37
406	398	Mathematics is the art of clever forgetting.  The first mathematical breakthrough, numbers, came about when people realized that if you just forgot about whether it was 5 cows + 3 cows, or 5 rocks + 3 rocks or whatever you always got 8.  Numbers are what you get when you look at collections of objects and forget what kind of object they are.When you say "as sets" you mean you're forgetting a lot of information, in particular you don't care about what the names of the elements in that set are or what properties those elements have.  As sets the positive numbers and the positive even numbers are "the same" (that is are in bijection) because you can take 1,2,3,...  and just rename 1 to 2, and 2 to 4, and n to 2n, and you've just renamed all the elements and got the even numbers!However, if you want to remember more about these sets, for example that they're not arbitrary sets they're both subsets of the natural numbers, then they become distinguishable.  Depending on how you want to measure "size of a subset of the natural numbers" they might be different sizes.  For example, a common way to measure "size of a subset of the natural numbers" is by its "density."  That is you look at the first N numbers and calculate what fraction of them are in your set, and then take the limit as N goes to infinity (warning for sufficiently complicated sets this limit might not exist).  So for your two examples, one has density 1 and the other has density 1/2, which is one way to make precise the intuition that the former is bigger as a subset of the natural numbers (though not as a set) than the latter.	37
407	398	Your example is an example of a countable sets: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_setAs others have explained, if you find a bijection between these two sets then they are of the same cardinality or have the same number of elements.(I hope that statement is true :)) But in this case you have found one with N which is what makes it a countable set. f(x)=2x would be an example of a bijection between N and 2N. Since for every x in the set of natural numbers there is a corresponding number in the set of 2N (only one) then you can say that they have the same cardinality. A cooler example would be the interval of the real numbers (0, 1) and R itself, those are not countable but their cardinality is the same.Other notes, if you are wondering what aleph is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number	1
408	405	If you want to avoid too much category theory, you can first read this link to understand the definition of monads in Haskell. Then look at Wikibooks for a more mathematical look (thanks Jonathan Fischoff).There are two descriptions that I know of. The first can easily be found by looking at wiki under Monad or consulting Harry's nice summary. The second is more interesting in my opinion.I will assume that you don't know the definition of a monoidal action, if you do, just skip ahead.A monoidal action is a functor from a monoid to the category of endofunctors on a category satisfying two coherence relations. These two coherence relations simply verify that your monoidal product is the same as composition in the target, and that the identity object behaves with the action. The relations are normally written as diagrams, but without latex implement, I wont type them here. To get an idea of a monoidal action, consider a group action, and formulate it a little more categorically, by writing the two axioms as diagrams. These diagrams, when converted to the language of monoidal categories, are exactly those of a monoidal action.Now the best part is once you have monoidal action, monads on a category are simply the category of monoidal actions from the trivial monoidal category to your category. Note here that the trivial monoidal category will be the monoidal category with one object one morphism and all the other monoidal data is trivially determined. The monadic coherence relations come for free from your monoidal action coherence relations.So, my simple explanation?In this way, we can formulate monads functorially as "representations" of the trivial monoidal category. One can readily show the two definitions are the same.	13
409	370	Another book that is more elementary, not requiring any algebraic topology for motivation, and formulating the basics through a question and answer approach is:Conceptual MathematicsAn added benefit is that it is written by an expert!	29
411	Why do complex functions have a finite radius of convergence?	Say we have a function $\displaystyle f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ with radius of convergence $R>0$. Why is the radius of convergence only $R$? Can we conclude that there must be a pole, branch cut or discontinuity for some $z_0$ with $|z_0|=R$? What does that mean for functions like$$f(z)=\begin{cases}  0 & \text{for $z=0$} \\\  e^{-\frac{1}{z^2}} & \text{for $z \neq 0$} \end{cases}$$that have a radius of convergence $0$?	10
412	405	Let $C$ be a category.  Then a monad based at $C$ is a monoid in the strict monoidal category $$\mathcal{End}(C)=\mathcal{Hom}_{Cat}(C,C),$$where the natural monoidal product is given by composition of endofunctors, and the monoidal unit is the identity functor.  A monoid in a monoidal category is defined here.  If you need more explanation, just give me a call.Notation: The category of functors $C\to D$ is also written as $Fun(C,D)$, but this notation is nonstandard.  The standard notations are $\mathcal{Hom}_{Cat}(C,D)$ or simply $Cat(C,D)$.	4
413	411	If the radius of convergence is $R$, that means there is a singular point on the circle $|z| = R$. In other words, there is a point $\xi$ on the circle of radius $R$ such that the function cannot be extended via "analytic continuation" in a neighborhood of $\xi$.  This is a straightforward application of compactness of the circle and can be found in books on complex analysis, e.g. Rudin's. However, it does not mean that there is a pole, branch cut, or discontinuity, though those would cause singular values. Indeed, a "pole" on the boundary would only make sense if you can analytically continue the power series to some proper domain containing the disk $D_R(0)$, and this is generally impossible. For instance, the power series $\sum z^{2^j}$ cannot be continued in any way outside the unit disk, because it is unbounded along any ray whose angle is a dyadic fraction.  The unit circle is its natural boundary, though it does not make sense to say that the function has a branch point or pole there.  (More generally, one can show that given any domain in the plane, there is a holomorphic function in that domain which cannot be extended any further, essentially using variations on the same theme.)The function $\sum_j \frac{z^j}{j^2}$, incidentally, is continuous on the closed unit disk, but even though there is a singular point there. So continuity may happen at singular points.The last function you mention does not have a power series expansion in a neighborhood of zero. In fact, it is not continuous at zero, because it blows up if you approach zero along the imaginary axis.	16
414	Why do we use the commutator bracket for Lie algebra's	We define Lie algebras abstractly as algebras whose multiplication satisfies anti-commutativity and Jacobi's Identity. A particular instance of this is an associative algebra equipped with the commutator bracket:  $[a,b]=ab-ba$. However, the notation suggests that this bracket is the one we think about. Additionally, the right adjoint to the functor I just mentioned creates the universal enveloping algebra by quotienting the tensor algebra by the tensor version of this bracket; but we could always start with some arbitrary Lie algebra with  some other satisfactory bracket and apply this functor.My question is   "Why the commutator bracket?"Is it purely from a historical standpoint (and if so could you explain why)? Or is there a result that says any Lie algebra is essentially one with the commutator bracket (maybe something about the faithfulness of the functor from above)?I know of (a colleague told me) a proof that the Jacobi identity is also an artifact of the right adjoint to the universal enveloping algebra. He can show that it is the necessary identity for the universal enveloping algebra to be associative (if someone knows of this in the literature I would also appreciate the link to this!)I hope this question is clear, if not, I can revise and try to make it a bit more specific.	3
415	What property of certain regular polygons allows them to be faces of the Platonic Solids?	It appears to me that only Triangles, Squares, and Pentagons are able to "tessellate" (is that the proper word in this context?) to become regular 3D convex polytopes.What property of those regular polygons themselves allow them to faces of regular convex polyhedron?  Is it something in their angles?  Their number of sides?Also, why are there more Triangle-based Platonic Solids (three) than Square- and Pentagon- based ones? (one each)Similarly, is this the same property that allows certain Platonic Solids to be used as "faces" of regular polychoron (4D polytopes)?	17
416	415	The regular polygons that form the Platonic solids are those for which the measure of the interior angles, say α for convenience, is such that $3\alpha<2\pi$ (360°) so that three (or more) of the polygons can be assembled around a vertex of the solid.Regular (equilateral) triangles have interior angles of measure $\frac{\pi}{3}$ (60°), so they can be assembled 3, 4, or 5 at a vertex ($3\cdot\frac{\pi}{3}<2\pi$, $4\cdot\frac{\pi}{3}<2\pi$, $5\cdot\frac{\pi}{3}<2\pi$), but not 6 ($6\cdot\frac{\pi}{3}=2\pi$--they tesselate the plane).Regular quadrilaterals (squares) have interior angles of measure $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (90°), so they can be assembled 3 at a vertex ($3\cdot\frac{\pi}{2}<2\pi$), but not 4 ($4\cdot\frac{\pi}{2}=2\pi$--they tesselate the plane).Regular pentagons have interior angles of measure $\frac{3\pi}{5}$ (108°), so they can be assembled 3 at a vertex ($3\cdot\frac{3\pi}{5}<2\pi$), but not 4 ($4\cdot\frac{3\pi}{5}>2\pi$).Regular hexagons have interior angles of measure $\frac{2\pi}{3}$ (120°), so they cannot be assembled 3 at a vertex ($3\cdot\frac{2\pi}{3}=2\pi$--they tesselate the plane).Any other regular polygon will have larger interior angles, so cannot be assembled into a regular solid.	27
417	414	Well Lie algebras naturally arise from the Lie bracket of vector fields and from taking the Lie algebra of a Lie group.  If we look at a the Lie algebra of a matrix subgroup, then the Lie bracket is the commutator of matrices.	2
418	Construct a bijection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$, where $S$ is countable	Two questions:Find a bijective function from $(0,1)$ to $[0,1]$. I haven't found the solution to this since I saw it a few days ago. It strikes me as odd--mapping a open set into a closed set.$S$ is countable. It's trivial to find a bijective function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}\setminus S$ when $|\mathbb{N}| = |\mathbb{N}\setminus S|$; let $f(n)$ equal the $n^{\text{th}}$ smallest number in $\mathbb{N}\setminus S$. Are there any analogous trivial solutions to $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\setminus S$?	16
419	What can we conclude from correlation?	I just got my statistics test back and I am totally confused about one of the questions!    A study was done that took a simple random sample of 40 people and measured whether  the subjects were right-handed or  left-handed, as well as their ages.  The study showed that the proportion  of left-handed people and the ages had  a strong negative correlation. What  can we conclude? Explain your answer. I know that we can't conclude that getting older causes people to become right-handed. Something else might be causing it, not the age. If two things are correlated, we can only conclude association, not causation. So I wrote:   We can conclude that many people  become right-handed as they grow  older, but we cannot tell why.That's exactly what association means, but my teacher marked me wrong! What mistake did I make? Is 40 too small of a sample size to make any conclusions?	5
420	418	The proof of the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem allows you to get a bijection for 1, since we have an injection $(0,1) \to [0,1]$ and a bijection $f: [0,1] \to [1/4, 3/4] \subset (0,1)$ (say $x \to x/2 +1/4$).  The function's definition will be somewhat messy (basically, it depends on how many times you can lift a point under these to injections already defined, and specifically the parity of the number of times), but it'll do it.For 2, iterate this construction to get a bijection $R \to R - N$.  Then given any countable set $S$, define the map of $R$ that interchanges $N$ and $S$ and leaves every other point fixed.  Then the composition of the first bijection with this second map is your bijection.Continuity considerations imply that the map can't be continuous: in 1, for instance, we'd otherwise have that $(0,1)$ is compact, which it's not.	10
421	419	This is wrong: "We can conclude that many people become right-handed as they grow older." We cannot conclude this at all from the given data. For one, the study only takes a sample at one point in time, rather than selecting a sample and monitoring their progress through many decades. This is what would be needed for us to even entertain the possibility that aging causes a change in handedness. Other possible causes include that left handed people might have a shorter life expectancy, or perhaps there was a spike in the birth rate of right handed people in the past. There are many other possibilities that have been mentioned in others answers which would also account for the skewed proportions without requiring people to change handedness with age, which is what you falsely concluded in the test.Also, just an observation, but it appears the "study" was conducted under false pretenses. Handedness is a false dichotomy, people can also be ambidextrous.	3
422	240	In mathematics you can construct a mathematical theory with different sets of axioms. This can be really useful. When mathematicians ignored the parallel line axiom in Euclidian geometry it gave raise to non-Euclidian geometries, which became really important in Einsteinian physics.An axiom of logic is the law of the excluded third which basically says that one statement is either true or false. This means that any theorem that depends completely in this axiom is not valid on mathematical theories that decide to ignore the axiom.A proof by contradiction is using the axiom directly; if the consequent is false then the antecent is false, then the converse of the consequent is true (because it must be either true or false). If the theorem can be proved in a constructive way, then it does not depend on the Law of Excluded Third and is valid in theories that does not use the law.	1
423	Intuitive reasoning behind the Chain Rule in multiple variables?	I've sort of gotten a grasp on the Chain rule with one variable.  If you hike up a mountain at 2 feet an hour, and the temperature decreases at 2 degrees per feet, the temperature would be decreasing for you at $2\times 2 = 4$ degrees per hour.But I'm having a bit more trouble understanding the Chain Rule as applied to multiple variables.  Even the case of 2 dimensions $$z = f(x,y),$$ where $x = g(t)$ and $y = h(t)$, so$$\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial z}{dy} \frac{dy}{dt}.$$Now, this is easy enough to "calculate" (and figure out what goes where).  My teacher taught me a neat tree-based graphical method for figuring out partial derivatives using chain rule.  All-in-all, it was rather hand-wavey.  However, I'm not sure exactly how this works, intuitively.Why, intuitively, is the equation above true?  Why addition?  Why not multiplication, like the other chain rule?  Why are some multiplied and some added?	12
424	419	We can only conclude that the result is interesting and it deserves more research.Without further study we can not say if right-handedness causes age (ie. being left handed causes biological alterations that shorten the life span), age causes right-handedness (ie. as people age they become right handed), they are correlated because they are caused by another variable (ie. older people became educated in a different system that discouraged left-handedness), the study had bad luck selecting its sample, the study sample was bad designed, the study was bad designed, etc.	0
425	423	Changing time is the same as changing x and changing y. If the changes each one caused in z didn't interact, then the total change would be the sum of both changes. If the function is well behaved (differentiatable) then the interaction caused by an infinitesimal change in x with an infinitesimal change in y will be doubly infinitesimal. The proof of the double chain rule just shows this formally.	0
426	423	The correct context of the chain rule is that taking the tangent bundle is functorial.  A more down-to-earth answer is provided by working coordinate free using linear algebra.  Suppose $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are functions between Banach spaces (these are a generalized version of R^n) such that $f$ is differentiable at $\vec{v}$ and $g$ is differentiable at $f(\vec{v})$ (note that in the general case we must require that their derivatives are toplinear (continuous and linear), since not all linear maps are continuous in the context of infinite dimensional spaces).Then taking the total differential, we see that the chain rule is equivalent to saying that: $$T_\vec{v}(g\circ f)=T_{f(\vec{v})}(g) \circ T_\vec{v}(f).$$  The description you get with coordinates comes from this very much simpler presentation (Where T denotes the total differential) as follows: To derive the formula with coordinates (say, for example, in three dimensions), we present the total differentials (which are linear transformations) as their Jacobian matrices and test along the column vector ${}^t[x,y,z]$. (Where the leftthand exponent t denotes the matrix transpose).Note: When we present linear operators by their matrices, composition of linear transformations becomes matrix multiplication, and evaluation at a vector $\vec{w}$ becomes righthand multiplication by a column matrix.The main point is that coordinates obscure what's actually going on here.  The beauty of the coordinate free definition is destroyed by the complicated description of matrix multiplication.	8
427	240	Proof by contradiction is just as logically valid as any other type of proof. If you are unsure, I think it might help to consider exactly what a proof by contradiction entails.Say we have a set of statements $\Gamma$, and that $\Gamma\cup\{(\neg\phi)\}$ is not consistent. That is, the statement $\neg\phi$ contradicts something in $\Gamma$. (In other words, we supposed $\phi$ was false, and reached a contradiction.) Say that statement was $\psi$. Then $\Gamma\cup\{(\neg\phi)\}\vdash\psi$ and $\Gamma\cup\{(\neg\phi)\}\vdash \neg\psi$.By the principle of explosion, we conclude that $\Gamma\cup\{(\neg\phi)\}\vdash\phi$. (We can prove any statement, so we prove $\phi$.By deduction, we know that $\Gamma\vdash(\neg\phi\Rightarrow\phi)$.Most first-order logic systems have an axiom that gives us $((\neg\phi\Rightarrow\phi)\Rightarrow\phi$. I hope you can convince yourself that this is true without trouble.This yields $\Gamma\vdash\phi$.We started with the idea that the negation of the statement $\phi$ was incompatible with your working set of axioms and theorems $\Gamma$, and concluded that therefore $\Gamma$ proves $\phi$.  Of course, there is more than one way to prove anything. Other methods can often be more intuitive, more elegant, or may lead to some other useful results. However, that is distinct from "weaker." Proof by contradiction is perfectly sound.	0
428	423	Think of it in terms of causality & superposition.$$z = f(x,y)$$If you keep $y$ fixed then $\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{df}{dx} * \frac{dx}{dt}$If you keep $x$ fixed then $\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{df}{fy} * \frac{dy}{dt}$. Superposition says you can just add the two together.	2
429	423	The basic reason is that one is simply composing the derivatives just as one composes the functions. Derivatives are linear approximations to functions. When you compose the functions, you compose the linear approximations---not a surprise.I'm going to try to expand on Harry Gindi's answer, because that was the only way I could grok it, but in somewhat simpler terms.The way to think of a derivative in multiple variables is as a linear approximation.   In particular, let $f: R^m \to R^n$ and $q=f(p)$.  Then near $p$, we can write $f$ as $q$ basically something linear plus some "noise" which "doesn't matter" (i.e. is little oh of the distance to $p$).  Call this linear map $L: R^m \to R^n$.Now, suppose $g: R^n \to R^s$ is some map and $r = g(q)$.  We can approximate $g$ near $q$ by $r$ plus some linear map $N$ plus some "garbage" which is, again, small.For simplicity, I'm going to assume that $p,q,r$ are all zero. This is ok, because one can just move one's origin around a bit.So, as before, applying $f$ to a point near zero corresponds loosely to applying the linear transformation $L$. Applying $g$ to a point near zero corresponds loosely to applying $N$.  Hence applying $g \circ f$ corresponds up to some ignorable "garbage" to the map $N \circ L$. This means that $N \circ L$ is the linear approximation to $g \circ f$ at zero, in particular this composition is the derivative of $g \circ f$.	11
431	419	Here is one example of a plausible explanation that disagrees with your analysis:Cultural expectations for left- and right-handedness have changed over time. Older people may have gone to school at a time where left-handedness was discouraged and students were forced to write with their right hands, training children never to use the left hand instead of the right. Younger participants in the study were in school more recently and learned to write at a time where left-handedness was not discouraged, creating a positive correlation between left-handedness and youth.	1
432	Why does the discriminant of a cubic polynomial being less than $0$ indicate complex roots?	The discriminant $\Delta = 18abcd - 4b^3d + b^2 c^2 - 4ac^3 - 27a^2d^2$ of the cubic polynomial $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx+ d$ indicates not only if there are repeated roots when $\Delta$ vanishes, but also that there are three distinct, real roots if $\Delta > 0$, and that there is one real root and two complex roots (complex conjugates) if $\Delta < 0$.Why does $\Delta < 0$ indicate complex roots? I understand that because of the way that the discriminant is defined, it indicates that there is a repeated root if it vanishes, but why does $\Delta$ greater than $0$ or less than $0$ have special meaning, too?	18
433	432	The discriminant of any monic polynomial is the product $\prod_{i \neq j} (x_i - x_j)^2$ of the squares of the differences of the roots (in an algebraic closure, e.g. $C$). Cf. the Wikipedia article on this. Consequently, if the roots are all real and distinct, this must be positive.(If the polynomial is not monic, the factor $a_0^{2n-2}$ is thrown in, for $a_0$ the leading coefficient and $n$ the degree; this is positive for a real polynomial.)	14
434	How can there be explicit polynomial equations for which the existence of integer solutions is unprovable?	This answer suggests that there are explicit polynomial equations for which the existence (or nonexistence) of integer solutions is unprovable. How can this be?	8
435	250	Theorem: Any predicate which can be evaluated in polynomial time on a nondeterministic turing machine can be evaluated in polynomial time on a deterministic turing machine.Or is asking an open question cheating? :)	-7
437	434	Edit: This has been explained better by Joel David Hamkins; cf. this MO thread.This is because given any first-order formula $\phi(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ with $n$ parameters in the integers, there is a polynomial $P(x_1, \dots, x_n, z_1, \dots, z_m)$ which can be proved to have a root in $z_1, \dots, z_m$ in the integers if and only if $\phi(x_1, \dots, x_n)$---this is a version of Matiyasevich's solution to Hilbert's tenth problem.Now, it's possible to construct within any formal system explicit first-order formulas which can't be proved or disproved (for instance, the statement "this formal system is consistent").  This is  the second incompleteness theorem.  These first-order formulas correspond to polynomials by the first paragraph.In particular, one can show that you can construct a polynomial $P(z_1, \dots, z_m)$ corresponding to the statement "mathematics* is inconsistent" translated to a formula.  Thus, if mathematics is consistent, there's no mathematical proof that this polynomial doesn't have a root.*Mathematics=ZFC here.For more on these lines, see Ebbinghaus-Frum-Thomas's very accessible book on mathematical logic.	9
438	Why $\sqrt{-1 \times {-1}} \neq \sqrt{-1}^2$?	I know there must be something unmathematical in the following but I don't know where it is:\begin{align}\sqrt{-1} &= i \\ \\\frac1{\sqrt{-1}} &= \frac1i \\ \\\frac{\sqrt1}{\sqrt{-1}} &= \frac1i \\ \\\sqrt{\frac1{-1}} &= \frac1i \\ \\\sqrt{\frac{-1}1} &= \frac1i \\ \\\sqrt{-1} &= \frac1i \\ \\i &= \frac1i \\ \\i^2 &= 1 \\ \\-1 &= 1 \quad !!!\end{align}	99
439	438	Between your third and fourth lines, you use $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}=\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$.  This is only (guaranteed to be) true when $a\ge 0$ and $b>0$.edit:  As pointed out in the comments, what I meant was that the identity $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}=\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$ has domain $a\ge 0$ and $b>0$.  Outside that domain, applying the identity is inappropriate, whether or not it "works."In general (and this is the crux of most "fake" proofs involving square roots of negative numbers), $\sqrt{x}$ where $x$ is a negative real number ($x<0$) must first be rewritten as $i\sqrt{|x|}$ before any other algebraic manipulations can be applied (because the identities relating to manipulation of square roots [perhaps exponentiation with non-integer exponents in general] require nonnegative numbers).This similar question, focused on $-1=i^2=(\sqrt{-1})^2=\sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}\overset{!}{=}\sqrt{-1\cdot-1}=\sqrt{1}=1$, is using the similar identity $\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{ab}$, which has domain $a\ge 0$ and $b\ge 0$, so applying it when $a=b=-1$ is invalid.	108
440	Why isn't reflexivity redundant in the definition of equivalence relation?	An equivalence relation is defined by three properties: reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity.Doesn't symmetry and transitivity implies reflexivity? Consider the following argument.For any $a$ and $b$,$a R b$ implies $b R a$ by symmetry. Using transitivity, we have $a R a$.Source: Exercise 8.46, P195 of Mathematical Proofs, 2nd (not 3rd) ed. by Chartrand et al	45
441	440	Actually, without the reflexivity condition,   the empty relation would count as an equivalence relation, which is non-ideal.Your argument used the hypothesis that for each $a$, there exists $b$ such that $aRb$ holds. If this is true, then symmetry and transitivity imply reflexivity, but this is not true in general.	51
442	440	No.The missing condition is sometimes called  'seriality' -- for any x there must be a y such that x R y.If you add seriality to the symmetry and transitivity you get a reflexive relation again.	18
443	Why is the decimal representation of $\frac17$ "cyclical"?	$\frac17 = 0.(142857)$...with the digits in the parentheses repeating.I understand that the reason it's a repeating fraction is because $7$ and $10$ are coprime.  But this...cyclical nature is something that is not observed by any other reciprocal of any natural number that I know of (besides multiples of $7$). (if I am wrong, I hope that I may find others through this question)By "cyclical," I mean:1/7 = 0.(142857)...2/7 = 0.(285714)...3/7 = 0.(428571)...4/7 = 0.(571428)...5/7 = 0.(714285)...6/7 = 0.(857142)...Where all of the repeating digits are the same string of digits, but shifted.  Not just a simple "they are all the same digits re-arranged", but the same digits in the same order, but shifted.Or perhaps more strikingly, from the wikipedia article:1 × 142,857 = 142,8572 × 142,857 = 285,7143 × 142,857 = 428,5714 × 142,857 = 571,4285 × 142,857 = 714,2856 × 142,857 = 857,142What is it about the number $7$ in relation to the base $10$ (and its prime factorization $2\cdot 5$?) that allows its reciprocal to behave this way?  Is it (and its multiples) unique in having this property?Wikipedia has an article on this subject, and gives a form for deriving them and constructing arbitrary ones, but does little to show the "why", and finding what numbers have cyclic inverses.	30
444	443	It works with 1/19 = 0.(052631578947368421) too, while n/13 has two cycles: 1/13 = 0.(076923), 2/13 = 0.(153846), 3/13 = 0.(230769), 4/13 = 0.(307692), 5/13 = 0.(384615), and so on.That a cycle must appear when you have a prime number p different from the base in which we work (so in base 10 different from 2 and 5) is clear: if you perform the long division 1/p, sooner or later partial quotients must be repeated, and from that point on the quotients repeat themselves. The length of the cycle must be a divisor of p-1: it may be short (think at 1/11 = 0.(09) ) or have the maximum possible lenght like the cases of 7 and 19.Wikipedia has an article on Cyclic numbers, and some other example is also here; unfortunately no sufficient rule is given for a number to have its inverse cyclical.	10
445	443	For a prime p, the length of the repeating block of $\frac{1}{p}$ is the least positive integer k for which $p|(10^k-1)$.  As in mau's answer, $k|(p-1)$, so $k\leq p-1$.  When $k=p-1$, then $\frac{1}{p}$ and its multiples behave as discussed in the question.Of the first 100 primes, this is true for 7, 17, 19, 23, 29, 47, 59, 61, 97, 109, 113, 131, 149, 167, 179, 181, 193, 223, 229, 233, 257, 263, 269, 313, 337, 367, 379, 383, 389, 419, 433, 461, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 541 (sequence A001913 in OEIS).(List generated in Mathematica using Select[Table[Prime[n], {n, 1, 100}], # - 1 == Length[RealDigits[1/#][[1]][[1]]]&].)	22
446	418	An explicit bijection $(0,1) \to [0,1]$ for part $1$ is given by:$$f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 0,\quad f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 1,\quad f\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) = \frac{1}{n-2}\ \textrm{for}\ n > 3,$$$$f(x) = x\ \textrm{for}\ x\ \textrm{not equal to a reciprocal of an integer}$$For a bijection $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$, we can number the elements of $S$ (because $S$ is countable) as $s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots$ Choose an infinite sequence $t_1, t_2, \dots$ of distinct elements of $\mathbb{R}$, none of which are in $S$. Then define:$$g(s_i) = t_{2i},\quad g(t_i) = t_{2i+1},\quad g(x) = x\ (\textrm{otherwise}).$$This is a bijection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$.	17
448	In how many different ways can I sort balls of two different colors	Let's say, I have 4 yellow and 5 blue balls. How do I calculate in how many different orders I  can place them? And what if I also have 3 red balls?	9
449	381	Perhaps it's not an entirely practical application, but Fibonacci numbers can be used to convert from miles to kilometers and vice versa:  Take two consecutive Fibonacci  numbers, for example 5 and 8. And  you're done converting. No kidding –  there are 8 kilometers in 5 miles. To  convert back just read the result from  the other end - there are 5 miles in 8  km!But why does it work?  Fibonacci numbers have a property that  the ratio of two consecutive numbers  tends to the Golden ratio as  numbers get bigger and bigger. The  Golden ratio is a number and it  happens to be approximately 1.618.  Coincidentally, there are 1.609  kilometers in a mile, which is within  0.5% of the Golden ratio.	25
451	448	The case of two colors is simple: if you have m yellow balls and n blue ones you only need to choose m positions among (m+n) possibilities, that is (m+n)!/(m!·n!). The other balls' positions are automatically set up.	4
452	448	This is a standard problem involving the combinations of sets, though perhaps not very obvious intuitively.Firstly consider the number of ways you can rearrange the entire set of balls, counting each ball as indepndent (effectively ignoring colours for now). This is simply $(4 + 5)! = 9!$, since the 1st ball can be any of the $9$, the 2nd can be any of the remaining $8$, and so on.Then we calculate how many different ways the yellow balls can be arranged within themselves, since for the purpose of this problem they are considered equivalent. The number of combinations is of course $4!$; similarly, for the blue balls the number is $5!$.Hence, overall we find:$$\text{total arrangements} = \frac{\text{arrangements of all balls}}{\text{arrangements of yellow balls} \times \text{arrangements of blue balls}}$$Therefore in our case we have:$$\text{total arrangements} = \frac{9!}{5! \times 4!} = 126$$I'm sure you can see how this can be easily extended if we also have 3 red balls too. (Hint: the total changes and we have another multiple of identical arrangements to account for.)	8
453	450	No.  Everything is determined by a choice of basis.  For a more in-depth answer, I would need to explain the first two weeks of linear algebra and draw some commutative diagrams.If you'd like a better explanation, see pages 12-14 of Emil Artin's monograph Geometric Algebra.	-1
454	356	The Art of Computer Programming(Donald Knuth)The legendary book (of multiple volumes, still incomplete) can't go without mention. For learning about algorithms and their complexities, there is no rival. It's written with practicality in mind, though from a largely theoretical perspective.	8
455	450	You can't represent a non linear transformation with a matrix, however there are some tricks (for want of a better word) available if you use homogenous co-ordinates. For example, 3d translation is a non-linear transformation in a 3x3 3d transformation matrix, but is a linear transformation in 3d homogenous co-ordinates using a 4x4 transformation matrix. The same is true of other things like perspective projections. This is why 4x4 matrices are used in 3d graphics as the homogenous co-ordinate system simplifies things a lot.To clarify - using homogenous co-ordinates increases the range of transformations representable using matrices from plain linear transformations to affine transformations and some projections, but it doesn't make all non-linear transformations representable using matrices. The non-linear transformation provided as an example is still beyond representation as an affine transformation (Thanks to  for prompting this clarification in the comments)	1
456	450	As Harry says, you can't (the example of affine transformations can be tweaked to work because they're just linear ones with the origin translated). However, approximating a nonlinear function by a linear one is something we do all the time in calculus through the derivative, and is what we often have to do to make a mathematical model of some real-world phenomenon tractable.	6

460	Are there any interesting semigroups that aren't monoids?	Are there any interesting and natural examples of semigroups that are not monoids (that is, they don't have an identity element)?To be a bit more precise, I guess I should ask if there any interesting examples of semigroups $(X, \ast)$ for which there is not a monoid $(X, \ast, e)$ where $e$ is in $X$. I don't consider an example like the set of real numbers greater than 10 (considered under addition) to be a sufficiently 'natural' semigroup for my purposes; if the domain can be extended in an obvious way to include an identity element then that's not what I'm after.	32
461	448	For some reason I find it easier to think in terms of letters of a word being rearranged, and your problem is equivalent to asking how many permutations there are of the word YYYYBBBBB. The formula for counting permutations of words with repeated letters (whose reasoning has been described by Noldorin) gives us the correct answer of 9!/(4!5!) = 126.	3
462	How do proof verifiers work?	I'm currently trying to understand the concepts and theory behind some of the common proof verifiers out there, but am not quite sure on the exact nature and construction of the sort of systems/proof calculi they use. Are they essentially based on higher-order logics that use Henkin semantics, or is there something more to it? As I understand, extending Henkin semantics to higher-order logic does not render the formal system any less sound, though I am not too clear on that.Though I'm mainly looking for a general answer with useful examples, here are a few specific questions:What exactly is the role of type theory in creating higher-order logics? Same goes with category theory/model theory, which I believe is an alternative.Is extending a) natural deduction, b) sequent calculus, or c) some other formal system the best way to go for creating higher order logics?Where does typed lambda calculus come into proof verification?Are there any other approaches than higher order logic to proof verification?What are the limitations/shortcomings of existing proof verification systems (see below)?The Wikipedia pages on proof verification programs such as HOL Light Coq, and Metamath give some idea, but these pages contain limited/unclear information, and there are rather few specific high-level resources elsewhere. There are so many variations on formal logics/systems used in proof theory that I'm not sure quite what the base ideas of these systems are - what is required or optimal and what is open to experimentation.Perhaps a good way of answering this, certainly one I would appreciate, would be a brief guide (albeit with some technical detail/specifics) on how one might go about generating a complete proof calculus (proof verification system) from scratch? Any other information in the form of explanations and examples would be great too, however.	22
463	462	I'll answer just part of your question: I think the other parts will become clearer based on this.A proof verifier is essentially a program that takes one argument, a proof representation, and checks that this is properly constructed, and says OK if it is, and either fails silently otherwise, or highlights what is invalid otherwise.In principle, the proof representation could just be a sequence of formulae in a Hilbert system: all logics (at least, first-orderisable logics) can be represented in such a way.  You don't even need to say which rule is specified at each step, since it is decidable whether any formula follows by a rule application from earlier formulae.In practice, though, the proof representations are more complex.  Metamath is rather close to Hilbert systems, but has a rich set of rules.  Coq and LF use (different) typed lambda calculi with definitions to represent the steps, which are computationally quite expensive to check (IIRC, both are PSPACE hard).  And the proof verifier can do much more: Coq allows ML programs to be extracted from proofs.	10
465	83	Seymour Papert's ideas about "maths you can build".  Look at Scratch (much inspired by Papert), and read Mindstorms; note that quite a few of his ideas there are contentious, but there is a lot of maths you can make exciting this way.	2
467	460	Convolution of functions/distributions is useful in a variety of fields, and the identity element, the dirac delta, is not strictly a function.	25
468	460	Let G be the set of (continuous) functions f: R -> R where f(x) tends to 0 as x tends to infinity: $lim_{x\to \infty}f(x) = 0$. The operator is the usual point-wise multiplication of functions.G is closed under * since lim(f(x)) = 0 and lim(g(x)) = 0 imply lim(f(x)*g(x)) = 0.  G is a subgroup of {f: R->R}, so the identity must be the same - the function which is constantly 1. But this identity is not in G.EDIT: As Harry correctly points out, {f: R->R} is not a group. Therefore the following correction is needed: consider only functions such that $f(x) \neq 0$ everywhere.	0
469	What is the meaning of the double turnstile symbol ($\models$)?	What's the meaning of the double turnstile symbol in logic or mathematical notation? :  $\models$	24
470	469	It is a symbol from model theory denoting entailment.A ⊧ B is read as "A entails B".	5
472	469	It is called a 'double turnstile': http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_turnstile.	4
473	469	$\models$ is also known as the satisfication relation. For a structure $\mathcal{M}=(M,I)$ and an $\mathcal{M}$-assignment $\nu$, $(\mathcal{M},\nu)\models \varphi$ means that the formula $\varphi$ is true with the particular assignment $\nu$.See http://www.trinity.edu/cbrown/topics_in_logic/struct/node2.html	6

477	Cardinality of set of real continuous functions	The set of all $\mathbb{R\to R}$ continuous functions is $\mathfrak c$. How to show that? Is there any bijection between $\mathbb R^n$ and the set of continuous functions?	36
478	469	Just to enlarge on Harry's answer:Your symbol denotes one of two specified notions of implication in formal logic $\vdash$ -the turnstile symbol denotes syntactic implication (syntactic here means  related to syntax, the structure of a sentence), where the 'algebra' of the logical system in play (for example sentential calculus) allows us to 'rearrange and cancel' the stuff we know on the left into the thing we want to prove on the right.An example might be the classic "all men are mortal $\wedge$ socrates is a man $\vdash$ socrates is mortal" ('$\wedge$' of course here just means 'and'). You can almost imagine cancelling out the 'man bit' on the left to just give the sentence on the right (although the truth may be more complex...).$\models$ -the double turnstile, on the other hand, is not so much about algebra as meaning (formally it denotes semantic implication)- it means that any interpretation of the stuff we know on the left must have the corresponding interpretation of the thing we want to prove on the right true.An example would be if we had an infinite set of sentences: $\Gamma$:= {"1 is lovely", "2 is lovely", ...} in which all numbers appear, and the sentence A= " the natural numbers are precisely {1,2,...}" listing all numbers. Any interpretation would give us B="all natural numbers are lovely". So $\Gamma$, A $\models$ B. Now, the goal of any logician trying to set up a formal system is to have $\Gamma \vdash A \iff \Gamma \models A$, meaning that the 'algebra' must line up with the interpretation, and this is not something we can take as given. Take the second example above- can we be sure that algebraic operations can 'parse' those infinitely many sentences and make the simple sentence on the right?? (this is to do with a property called compactness)The goal can be split into two distict subgoals:Soundness: $A \vdash B \Rightarrow A \models B$Completeness: $A \models B \Rightarrow A \vdash B$Where the first stops you proving things that aren't true when we interpret them and the second means that everything we know to be true on interpretation, we must be able to prove.Sentential calculus, for example, can be proved complete (and was in Godel's lesser known, but celebrated completeness theorem), but other for other systems Godel's incompleteness theorem, give us a terrible choice between the two.In summary: The interplay of meaning and axiomatic machine mathematics, captured by the difference between $\models$ and $\vdash$, is a subtle and interesting thing.	36
479	477	The cardinality is at least that of the continuum because every real number corresponds to a constant function.  The cardinality is at most that of the continuum because the set of real continuous functions injects into the sequence space $R^{N}$ by mapping each continuous function to its values on all the rational points. Since the rational points are dense, this determines the function.The Schroeder-Bernstein theorem now implies the cardinality is precisely that of the continuum.Note that  then the set of sequences of reals is also of the same cardinality as the reals.  This is because if we have a sequence of binary representations $.a_1a_2..., .b_1b_2..., .c_1c_2...$, we can splice them together via $.a_1 b_1 a_2 c_1 b_2 a_3...$ so that a sequence of reals can be encoded by one real number.	56

486	Software for solving geometry questions	When I used to compete in Olympiad Competitions back in high school, a decent number of the easier geometry questions were solvable by what we called a geometry bash. Basically, you'd label every angle in the diagram with the variable then use a limited set of basic geometry operations to find relations between the elements, eliminate equations and then you'd eventually get the result. It seems like the kind of thing you could program a computer to do. So, I'm curious, does there exist any software to do this? I know there is lots of software for solving equations, but is there anything that lets you actually input a geometry problem without manually converting to equations? I'm not looking for anything too advance, even seeing just an attempt would be interesting. If there is anything decent, I think it'd be rather interesting to run the results on various competitions and see how many of the questions it solves.	12
487	2	A rigorous mathematical treatment follows:We say the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is $\tau$ iff for all $\varepsilon$ in $\mathbb R^+$ there exists delta in $\mathbb R^+$ such that $|x-c|< \delta$ implies $|f(x)-\tau| < \varepsilon$.	4
491	2	There are two slightly different types of limits (at least, in one real variable, as in single-variable calculus): limits as a variable goes to positive or negative infinity, and limits as a variable goes to some real value.The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to infinity (or as $x$ goes to negative infinity) is asking what happens to $f(x)$ at the right (left) end of its graph.  Does $f(x)$ get arbitrarily close to a single real number as $x$ increases (or decreases) without bound--that is, as $x$ gets really big and positive (or really big and negative)?The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to some real value, say $c$, is asking what happens to $f(x)$ near, but not at, $x = c$.  Does $f(x)$ get arbitrarily close to a single real number as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $c$?"Arbitrarily close" is used somewhat informally above, but these ideas can be translated into more rigorous definitions (as in other people's answers) by reformulating "arbitrarily close" in terms of inequalities with $\varepsilon$; and/or $\delta$.  Also, while a limit is said to not exist if there isn't the single real number as described above, it is somewhat common to talk about the limit being infinity (or negative infinity) if the limit does not exist, but the values of $f(x)$ increase without bound (or decrease without bound).	5

495	486	This is just a special case of automated theorem proving. A nice thing is some geometry problem can indeed be solved by an algorithm.There are theories show such system can be realized algorithmically. I don't know if anyone have really wrote the program to do it. JGEX seems to do that.A mechanical geometry proof technique was popularized in China by Jingzhong Zhang. He first introduced it as a way for machines to solve geometric problems relating the proportions between areas, lengths or angles. Then some Olympiad people I know start using it to bash that kind of problem. I don't know what the name is in English, but a literal translation of the method is "point removal method". Although it's not exactly same as what you are talking about, because "input a geometry problem" requires you to provide the construction of the problem from a straight edge and a compass, which is almost like "manually converting to equations". the basic idea:Construct the original problem by compass and straightedge, make a list of every constructed point ordered by the order of construction, let it be L. Record which points are used in the construction of every point.(Only the points used to construct point P are used in the substitution steps 3 and 4)Translate the theorem into a equivalent form. Usually a/b = 1, where a and b are functions of length and area of certain segments or triangles. Let's call this equation E.Let P be the last point of L. For every P appears in E, substitute it with another relation using other points from L(P itself is also allowed), usually if we are proving about lengths, we might use area. A list of possible operations are required for this step. It can branches off as a proof tree when the program decide to use different substitutions.Do another substitution that eliminates the point P. For example, if in the step before, we substitute length to area, then we want to find something involve the length.Do 3 to 4 over and over until we have 1=1An example: Angle bisector theoremGiven: $AD$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ of triangle $\triangle ABC$. Let $XYZ$ be the area of triangle $\triangle XYZ$, and $XY$ be the length of segment $XY$.Prove: $\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BD}{DC}$Proof:First construct $ABC$. Then construct $AD$. The points in the list $L$ are $A,B,C,D$.The equivalent equation to the theorem is$\frac{AB}{AC} \frac{DC}{BD} = 1$$\frac{AB}{AC} \frac{DC}{BD} = \frac{AB}{AC} \frac{ACD}{ABD}$ (substitute length with area)$=\frac{AB}{AC} \frac{\frac{1}{2} AC\cdot AD \sin \angle CAD}{\frac{1}{2} AB\cdot AD \sin \angle BAD}$, this step successfully remove point $D$ by cancellation.$=\frac{AB}{AC} \frac{AC}{AB} =1$This is only a non-formal explanation of how such automated system would work. I think the following book from Zhang will tell you more about it: Machine proofs in geometry: automated production of readable proofs for geometry theorems. I did not read the book, but the description of it seems like what you are seeking. A few paper by Zhang and his colleague can be found in the JGEX's website. The JGEX documentation on it's automated theorem prover is also a great resource.	7

When I got to grad school, category theory was assumed and made some of my courses much harder than they should've been. In the words of Ravi Vakil, "algebraic geometry should be learned slowly over a number of years". I currently NEED algebraic geometry, so I don't have this number of years. I wish I would've started that a long time ago. Additionally, both of these topics would've helped me learn the things I was thinking about anyways, in particular commutative algebra.	30

501	If all sets were finite, how could the real numbers be defined?	An extreme form of constructivism is called finitisim.  In this form, unlike the standard axiom system, infinite sets are not allowed.  There are important mathematicians, such as Kronecker, who supported such a system.  I can see that the natural numbers and rational numbers can easily defined in a finitist system, by easy adaptations of the standard definitions.   But in order to do any significant mathematics, we need to have definitions for the irrational numbers that one is likely to encounter in practice, such as  e  or sqrt(2).  In standard constructions, real numbers are defined as Dedekind cuts, or Cauchy sequences, which are actually sets of infinite cardinality, so they are of no use here. My question is, how would a real number like those be defined in a finitist axiom system.  (Of course we have no hope to construct the entire set of real numbers, since that set is uncountably infinite.) After doing a little research  I found a constructivist definition in Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics)#Example_from_real_analysis , but we need a finitist definition of a function for this definition to work. (Because in the standard system, a function over the set of natural numbers is actually an infinite set.)So my question boils down to this:  How can we define a function f over the natural numbers in a finitist axiom system? Original version of this question, which had been closed during private beta, is as follows:  If all sets were finite, how would mathematics be like?  If we replace the axiom that 'there  exists an infinite set' with 'all sets  are finite', how would mathematics be  like? My guess is that, all the theory  that has practical importance would  still show up, but everything would be  very very unreadable for humans. Is  that true?  We would have the natural numbers,  athough the class of all natural  numbers would not be a set. In the  same sense, we could have the rational  numbers. But could we have the real  numbers? Can the standard  constructions be adapted to this  setting?	37
504	501	There is a fragment of mathematics that is given by a set of axioms known as the Peano axioms. Using these rules you can carry out a vast amount of mathematics relating to natural numbers. For example you can prove lots of theorems in number theory using these axioms. The Peano axioms make no reference to sets at all, whether finite or infinite. The only things that exist in this theory are naturals. You can't even form the set of all integers. You can only talk about the naturals themselves. So a vast amount of mathematics would work absolutely fine.Even though Peano's axioms are about naturals, you can already use them to talk about finite sets. The idea is that any finite set could be encoded as a finite sequence of symbols which in turn could be represented as naturals using Godel numbering. So questions like "is this set a subset of that one?" could be turned into purely arithmetical statements about Godel numbers.So I'm pretty sure that declaring that there is no infinite set would make little difference to people working within the system defined by Peano's axioms. We'd still have all of the natural numbers to work with, we just wouldn't be able to assemble them into a single entity, the set of all natural numbers.On the other hand, there are theorems that make essential use of an infinite set. Like Goodstein's theorem. Without infinite sets (or a substitute of some sort) it would be impossible to prove this result.So the overall result would be, I think, that you could still do lots of mathematics fine. The mathematics you could do wouldn't be all that weird. And you'd simply be depriving yourself of a useful proof technique.By the way, you'd still be able to say many things about real numbers. A real number can be thought of as a Cauchy sequence. A Cauchy sequence is a certain type of sequence of rational numbers. So many statements about real numbers, when unpacked, are really statements about rational, and hence naturals, but in disguise.Update: Uncovering precisely what parts of mathematics you need in order to prove things is a field known as reverse mathematics. Hilbert, and others mathematicians, were interested in trying to prove as much mathematics as possible using finite methods. Although it was ultimately shown that you can't carry out all mathematics using finite methods, it's surprising how much you can. Here's a paper that talks about a system called EA which has no infinite sets. Amazingly we can use results from analytic number theory in EA. This is because propositions about analytic functions can be interpreted as statements about natural numbers.	8
505	Can there be two distinct, continuous functions that are equal at all rationals?	Akhil showed that the Cardinality of set of real continuous functions is the same as the continuum, using as a step the observation that continuous functions that agree at rational points must agree everywhere, since the rationals are dense in the reals.This isn't an obvious step, so why is it true?	36
506	505	If there were two continuous functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that were equal at all rationals, then (because the rationals are dense) we can show that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) - g(x) = 0$ for all values of $a$ using a delta-epsilon proof.Since the difference of two continuous functions is continuous, we know $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) - g(x) = f(a) - g(a)$ for all $a$, and therefore $f(a) - g(a) = 0$ and $f(x) = g(x)$, proving that $f$ and $g$ must be identical.	10
507	505	Without resorting to ε-δ arguments: Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous real functions and $f(x) = g(x)$ for all rational $x$.  For any real number $c$ (in particular, an irrational $c$), there exists a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers  such that $\lim_{n \to \infty}x_{n}=c$.  Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous, $\lim_{n \to \infty}f({x_{n}})=f({c})$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty}g({x_{n}})=g({c})$.  Since $x_n$ is rational, $f(x_n) = g(x_n)$ for all $n$, so the two limits must be equal and so $f(c) = g(c)$ for all real $c$.	41

513	1	Infinity is an overloaded term that can mean many things.One common non-mathematical use of infinity is to refer to everything in the universe. This is not what mathematicians mean when they say infinity. That would be a kin to the set of all sets, which is a paradoxical concept that is not part of mathematical discourse.Mathematicians will use infinity as a way to represent a process that continues indefinitely. This is a kin to saying "take the limit as n goes to infinity", which is close to saying "continue this process indefinitely."Infinity is also use infinity to talk about size. All sets are either infinite or finite.The story doesn't stop there. There is something fundamentally different about sets like the points on a line, where there are no holes, and sets like the integers where there are holes. They are both infinite but one seems denser then the other. That's where whole countable uncountable thing comes in. Infinite sets have a size, but it is not a number in the traditional sense. Its more like "relative size". Bijections are how we determine size for infinite sets, which are explained well on this page, so I won't repeat the explanation. A more in-depth, but still understandable explanation is given in Computability and Logic by George Boolos.	4
514	Conjectures that have been disproved with extremely large counterexamples?	I just came back from my Number Theory course, and during the lecture there was mention of the Collatz Conjecture.I'm sure that everyone here is familiar with it; it describes an operation on a natural number -- n/2 if it is even, 3n+1 if it is odd.The conjecture states that if this operation is repeated, all numbers will eventually wind up at 1 (or rather, in an infinite loop of 1-4-2-1-4-2-1).I fired up Python and ran a quick test on this for all numbers up to 5.76 × 10^18 (using the powers of cloud computing and dynamic programming magic).  Which is millions of millions of millions.  And all of them eventually ended up at 1.Surely I am close to testing every natural number?  How many natural numbers could there be?  Surely not much more than millions of millions of millions. (I kid)I explained this to my friend, who told me, "Why would numbers suddenly get different at a certain point?  Wouldn't they all be expected to behave the same?"To which I said, "No, you are wrong!  In fact I am sure there are many conjectures which have been disproved by counterexamples that are extremely large!"And he said, "It is my conjecture that there are none! (and if any, they are rare)"Please help me, smart math people.  Can you provide a counterexample to his conjecture?  Perhaps, more convincingly, several?  I've only managed to find one! (Polya's)  One, out of the many thousands (I presume) of conjectures.  It's also one that is hard to explain the finer points to the layman.  Are there any more famous or accessible examples?	117
515	514	The wikipedia article on the Collatz conjecture gives these three examples of conjectures that were disproved with large numbers:Polya conjecture.Mertens conjecture.Skewes number.	36
516	514	The first example which came to my mind is the Skewes' number, that is the smallest natural number n for which π(n) > li(n). Wikipedia states that now the limit is near e727.952, but the first estimation was much higher.	23
517	118	Calculus is basically a way of calculating rates of changes (similar to slopes, but called derivatives in calculus), and areas, volumes, and surface areas (for starters).It's easy to calculate these kinds of things with algebra and geometry if the shapes you're interested in are simple.  For example, if you have a straight line you can calculate the slope easily.  But if you want to know the slope at an arbitrary point (any random point) on the graph of some function like x-squared or some other polynomial, then you would need to use calculus.  In this case, calculus gives you a way of "zooming in" on the point you're interested in to find the slope EXACTLY at that point.  This is called a derivative.If you have a cube or a sphere, you can calculate the volume and surface area easily.  If you have an odd shape, you need to use calculus.  You use calculus to make an infinite number of really small slices of the object you're interested in, determine the sizes of the slices, and then add all those sizes up.  This process is called integration.  It turns out that integration is the reverse of derivation (finding a derivative).In summary, calculus is a tool that lets you do calculations with complicated curves, shapes, etc., that you would normally not be able to do with just algebra and geometry.	5
518	Why does a minimal prime ideal consist of zerodivisors?	Let $A$ be a commutative ring. Suppose $P \subset A$ is a minimal prime ideal. Then it is a theorem that $P$ consists of zero-divisors.This can be proved using localization, when $A$ is noetherian: $A_P$ is local artinian, so every element of $PA_P$ is nilpotent.  Hence every element of $P$ is a zero-divisor. (As Matt E has observed, when $A$ is nonnoetherian, one can still use a similar argument: $PA_P$ is the only prime in $A_P$, hence is the radical of $A_P$ by elementary commutative algebra.)Can this be proved without using localization?	32
519	How do you prove that a group specified by a presentation is infinite?	The group:$$G = \left\langle x, y \;  \left| \;  x^2 = y^3 = (xy)^7 = 1\right. \right\rangle$$is infinite, or so I've been told. How would I go about proving this? (To prove finiteness of a finitely presented group, I could do a coset enumeration, but I don't see how this helps if I want to prove that it's infinite.)	25
521	11	Okay I burned a lot of reputation points (at least for me) on MathOverflow to gain clarity on how to give some intuition into this problem, so hopefully this answer will be at least be somewhat illuminating. To gain a deeper understanding of what is going on, first we need to answer the question, "What is a number?"There are a lot of ways to define numbers, but in general numbers are thought of as symbols that represent sets. This is easy for things like the natural numbers. So 10 would correspond to the set with ten things -- like a bag of ten stones. Pretty straight forward.The tricky part is that when we consider ten a subset of the real numbers, we actually redefine it. This is not emphasized even in higher mathematics classes, like real analysis; it just happens when we define the real numbers. So what is 10 when constructed in the real numbers? Well, at least with the Dedekind cut version of the real numbers, all real numbers correspond to a set with an infinite amount of elements. This makes 10 under the hood look drastically different, although in practice it operates exactly the same.So let's return to the question: Why is 10 the same as 9.99999? Because the real numbers have this completely surprising quality, where there is no next real number. So when you have two real numbers that are as close together as possible, they are the same. I can't think of any physical object that has this quality, but it's how the real numbers work (makes "real" seem ironic).With integers (bag of stones version) this is not the same. When you have two integers as close to each other as possible they are still different, and they are distance one apart.Put another way, 10 bag of stones are not the same as 9.9999999 but 10 the natural number, where natural numbers are a subset of the real numbers is.The bottom line is that the real numbers have these tricky edge cases that are hard to understand intuitively. Don't worry, your intuition is not really failing you. :)I didn't feel confident answering until I got this Terence Tao link: http://www.google.com/buzz/114134834346472219368/RarPutThCJv/In-the-foundations-of-mathematics-the-standard.	45
522	514	A famous example that is not quite as large as these others is the prime race.  The conjecture states, roughly: Consider the first n primes, not counting 2 or 3. Divide them into two groups: A contains all of those primes congruent to 1 modulo 3 and B contains those primes congruent to 2 modulo 3. A will never contain more numbers than B. The smallest value of n for which this is false is 23338590792.	24
523	Is the set of all unique (convex) polygons countable? If so, by what bijection to the natural numbers?	Polygons are, in this question, defined as non-unique if they similar to another (by rotation, reflection, translation, or scaling).Would this answer be any different if similar but non-identical polygons were allowed?  And if only if rotated/translated by rational coefficients?Would this answer be any different if we constrained the length and internal angles of all polygons to rational numbers?Assume the number of sides is finite but unbounded, and greater than two.	2
524	How can I tell which matrix decomposition to use for OLS?	I want to find the least squares solution to $\boldsymbol{Ax}=\boldsymbol{b}$ where $\boldsymbol{A}$ is a highly sparse square matrix.I found two methods that look like they might lead me to a solution: QR factorization, and singular value decomposition. Unfortunately, I haven't taken linear algebra yet, so I can't really understand most of what those pages are saying. I can calculate both in Matlab though, and it looks like the SVD gave me a smaller squared error. Why did that happen? How can I know which one I should be using in the future?	5
526	523	There are uncountably many, because for example one can have rectangles with arbitrary side ratios.  For your second question, if everything is constrained to be rational, there will be countably many, because a polygon is uniquely determined by its ordered collection of sides and angles.This is part of a general fact: if $A$ is a countable set, then the collection of ordered $n$-tuples of elements of $A$ for all $n$ is still countable.	6
527	514	I heard this story from Professor Estie Arkin at Stony Brook (sorry, I don't know what conjecture she was talking about):  For weeks we tried to prove the conjecture (without success) while we left a computer running looking for counter-examples.  One morning we came in to find the computer screen flashing: "Counter-example found".  We all thought that there must have been a bug in the algorithm, but sure enough, it was a valid counter-example.  I tell this story to my students to emphasize that "proof by lack of counter-example" is not a proof at all![Edit] Here was the response from Estie:  It is mentioned in our paper:  Hamiltonian Triangulations for Fast Rendering  E.M. Arkin, M. Held, J.S.B. Mitchell, S.S. Skiena (1994). Algorithms -- ESA'94, Springer-Verlag, LNCS 855, J. van Leeuwen (ed.), pp. 36-47; Utrecht, The Netherlands, Sep 26-28, 1994.   Specifically section 4 of the paper, that gives an example of a set of points that does not have a so-called "sequential triangulation".  The person who wrote the code I talked about is Martin Held.	33
528	356	I think you should determine what kinds of applications you want to apply CS to and then learn general theory relevant to those applications.  Not all theory is equally applicable everywhere.	1
529	Why are the only division algebras over the real numbers the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions?	Why are the only (associative) division algebras over the real numbers the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions?Here a division algebra is an associative algebra where every nonzero number is invertible (like a field, but without assuming commutativity of multiplication).This is an old result proved by Frobenius, but I can't remember how the argument goes.  Anyone have a quick proof?	43
530	Can you find a domain where $ax+by=1$ has a solution for all $a$ and $b$ relatively prime, but which is not a PID?	In Intro Number Theory a key lemma is that if $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime integers, then there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax+by=1$.  In a more advanced course instead you would use the theorem that the integers are a PID, i.e. that all ideals are principal.  Then the old lemma can be used to prove that "any ideal generated by two elements is actually principal."  Induction then says that any finitely generated ideal is principal.  But, what if all finitely generated ideals are principal but there are some ideals that aren't finitely generated?  Can that happen?	15
532	531	The philosophy is explained in Doron Zeilberger's article. Basically, it's the belief that there is a largest natural number! I've heard a funny story (on Scott Aaronson's blog) about someone who was an ultrafinitist.-Do you believe in 1?-Yes, he responded immediately-Do you believe in 2?-Yes, he responded after a brief pause-Do you believe in 3? -Yes, he responded after a slightly longer pause-Do you believe in 4?-Yes, after several secondsIt soon become clear that he would take twice as long to answer the next question as the previous one. (I believe Alexander Esesin-Volpin was the person.)	31
533	Classifying Quasi-coherent Sheaves on Projective Schemes	I know some references where I can find this, but they seem tedious(Both Hartshorne and Ueno cover this).I am wondering if there is an elegant way to describe these. If this task is too difficult in general, how about just $\mathbb{P}^n$? Thanks!	7
534	Applications of the "soft maximum"	There is a little triviality that has been referred to as the "soft maximum" over on John Cook's Blog that I find to be fun, at the very least.  The idea is this:  given a list of values, say $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$ , the function $g(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = \log(\exp(x_1) + \exp(x_2) + \cdots + \exp(x_n))$ returns a value very near the maximum in the list.  This happens because that exponentiation exaggerates the differences between the $x_i$ values.  For the largest $x_i$, $\exp(x_i)$ will be $really$ large.  This largest exponential will significantly outweigh all of the others combined. Taking the logarithm, i.e. undoing the exponentiation,  we essentially recover the largest of the $x_i$'s.  (Of course, if two of the values were very near one another, we aren't guaranteed to get the true maximum, but it won't be far off!) About this, John Cook says: "The soft maximum approximates the hard maximum but it also rounds off the corners."  This couldn't really be said any better.  I recall trying to cleverly construct sequences for proofs in advanced calculus where not-everywhere-differentiable operations would have been great to use if they didn't have that pesky non-differentiable trait.  I can't recall a specific incidence where I was tempted to use $max(x_i)$, but this seems at least plausible that it would have come up.Has anyone used this before or have a scenario off hand where it would be useful?	7
537	536	I'll do 1D. 1D walks are building binary strings, 010101, etc.Say take six steps. Then 111111 is just as likely as 101010. However, how many of the possible sequences have six ones? 1. How many of the possibly sequences have three ones and three zeros? Much more. That number is called multiplicity, and it grows mighty fast. In the limit its log becomes Shannon entropy.Sequences are equally likely, but combinations are not.In the limit the combinations with maximum entropy are going dominate all the rest. So the walk is going to have gone an equal number of right and left steps...almost surely.	2
538	536	I can prove the 1 dimensional case a bit more formally than Jonathan. First we only look at the absolute values. Let us try to calculate the probability of this never exceeding x. The probability of 2x+1 consecutive moves all being the same is some p>0. If this ever occurs, then the absolute value will exceed x. Consider n groups of 2x+1 moves, the probability that at least one of these is all the same is 1-(1-p)^n, which approaches 1. So the probability of reaching each absolute value x (other than 0) is 1.Now, lets consider the probability of reaching 0 again. Without loss of generality, suppose our first move is +1. We have a 100% chance of reaching a point a distance of 1 from this. There is a 50% that the first such point is 0 and 50% that it is 2. From 2, we have a 100% chance of reaching a point two away from this. 50% chance that this is 0, 50% that this is 4. Repeating, it is easy to see that we have to reach 0 again.Furthermore, after we have reached an absolute value x, the probability of reaching it again is 1. So we reach each absolute value an infinite number of times. Due to symmetry, we can expect to reach each x an infinite number of times.EDIT: I originally tried to apply it to the 2d case as you can see below. This is incorrect, as even though there will be no maximal absolute value, there is no reason we will necessarily come back down.  Similar reasoning will work in the 2d  case. Instead of using symmetry, we  simply note that each point with the  same Manhattan distance from 0 has an  expected value that is a non-zero  proportion of the expected value all  points a particular Manhattan distance  away.	2

540	What is the Riemann-Zeta function?	In laymen's terms, as much as possible: What is the Riemann-Zeta function, and why does it come up so often with relation to prime numbers?	122
541	Which books would you recommend about Recreational Mathematics?	By this I mean books  with math puzzles and problems similar to the ones you would find in mathematical olympiads.	14
542	540	Giving an explanation in layman's terms is always going to be challenging, given that the Riemann-Zeta function (and related hypothesis) inevitably lies in the domain of abstract mathematics, but I shall do my best.The Riemann-Zeta function is a complex function that tells us many things about the theory of numbers. Its mystery is increased by the fact it has no closed form - i.e. it can't be expressed a single formula that contains other standard (elementary) functions.Although there are many different ways of expressing the Riemann-Zeta function (the Wikipedia article gives several), it can ultimately be derived from the following simple series of real numbers:$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty\dfrac1{n^s},\quad\Re(s)\gt1$by extending it into the complex plane.The reason this strange and esoteric function is so famous and actively discussed in mathematics is due to the Riemann hypothesis - proposed in 1859 by the great Bernhard Riemann and still unsolved. The Wiki article states the problem in quite simple terms:  The Riemann zeta-function ζ(s) is  defined for all complex numbers s ≠ 1.  It has zeros at the negative even  integers (i.e. at s = −2, −4, −6,  ...). These are called the trivial  zeros. The Riemann hypothesis is  concerned with the non-trivial zeros,  and states that:The real part of any non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2.  Thus the non-trivial zeros should lie  on the critical line, 1/2 + it, where  t is a real number and i is the  imaginary unit.Although the conjecture (it is only that at the moment) has many consequences for mathematics (number theory in particular), the primary one, at least the one Riemann originally proposed, is about the distribution of prime numbers. In other words, it tells us with great precision what the average gaps between primes are as we move to greater and greater numbers. Many of the other implications are rather more esoteric, though perhaps equally important for pure mathematicians.	31
544	What is a Markov Chain?	What is a intuitive explanation of a Markov Chain, and how they work? Please provide at least one practical example.	28
545	544	  A Markov chain is a discrete random  process with the property that the  next state depends only on the current  state (wikipedia)So $P(X_n | X_1, X_2, \dots X_{n-1}) = P(X_n | X_{n-1})$. An example could be when you are modelling the weather. You then can take the assumption that the weather of today can be predicted by only using the knowledge of yesterday.Let's say we have Rainy and Sunny. When it is rainy on one day the next day is Sunny with probability $0.3$. When it is Sunny, the probability for Rain next day is $0.4$. Now when it is today Sunny we can predict the weather of the day after tomorrow, by simply calculating the probability for Rain tomorrow, multiplying that with the probablity for Sun after rain plus the probability of Sun tomorrow times the probability of Sun after sun. In total the probability of Sunny of the day after tomorrow is $P(R|S) \cdot P(S|R) + P(S|S) \cdot P(S|S) = 0.3 \cdot 0.4+0.6 \cdot 0.6 = 0.48$.	27
546	544	In a nutshell, a Markov chain is (the behavior of) a random process which may only find itself in a (not necessarily finite) number of different states. The process moves from a state to another in discrete times (that is, you define a sequence S(t) of states at time t=0,1,2,...), and for which the probability of going from state S to state R depends just from S and R; that is, there is no "memory of the past" and the process is "timeless". This means that the Markov chain may be modeled as a n*n matrix, where n is the number of possible states. An example of a process which may be modeled by a Markov chain is the sequence of faces of a die showing up, if you are allowed to rotate the die wrt an edge. The corresponding matrix is     1   2   3   4   5   6   ------------------------ 1 | 0   1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 02 | 1/4 0   1/4 1/4 0   1/43 | 1/4 1/4 0   0   1/4 1/44 | 1/4 1/4 0   0   1/4 1/45 | 1/4 0   1/4 1/4 0   1/41 | 0   1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 0As usual, Wikipedia and MathWorld are your friends.	9
547	529	Essentially one first proves that any real division algebra $D$ is a Clifford algebra (i.e. it's generated by elements of some inner product vector space I subject to relations $v^2=\langle v, v\rangle$): first one splits $D$ as $\mathbb R\oplus D_0$ where $D_0$ is the space of elements with $Tr=0$ and then one observes that minimal polynomial of a traceless element has the form $x^2-a=0$ (it's quadratic because it's irreducible and the coefficient of $x$ is zero because it is the trace). Now it remains to find out which Clifford algebras are division algebras which is pretty straightforward (well, and it follows from the classification of Clifford algebras).This proof is written in Wikipedia.	14
549	548	It's undefined because $0/0 = 0$ is against the identity $a/a = 1$. Or at least, that's how I understand it, although there are probably deeper explanations that involve the consistency of algebra. You could also approach it in a simple manner from the direction that what you have is $0^1 \cdot 0^{-1}$ which would give you $0^0$ which is a very disturbing expression (and could be taken as either 0 or 1 depending on your definition of exponents).	0
550	392	From first principles,using trig identities and small-angle approximations:$$\sin'(x) = \lim\limits_{ h\to 0}\frac{\sin(x+h)-\sin(x)}{h}$$$$\sin(x+h) = \sin(x)\cos(h)+\cos(x)\sin(h)$$$$\Rightarrow  \sin'(x) =  \lim\limits_{ h\to 0}\frac{(\sin(x)(\cos(h)-1) + \cos(x)\sin(h))}{h}$$For $x$ small, $\sin(x)\sim x$, so $$\lim\limits_{ h\to 0}\frac{\sin h}{h}=1$$and $$\cos(x)\sim 1 -\frac {x^2} 2 $$ so $$\lim\limits_{ h\to 0}\frac{\cos h-1}{h}=0$$$$ \sin'(x) = \cos(x)$$$$\cos'(x) = \lim\limits_{ h\to 0}\frac{\cos(x+h)-\cos(x)}{h}$$$$\cos(x+h) = \cos(x)\cos(h) - \sin(x)\sin(h)$$$$\Rightarrow \cos'(x) = \lim\limits_{h\to0}\frac{\cos(x)(\cos(h)-1) - \sin(x)\sin(h)}{h}$$$$= -\sin(x)$$ by the same reasoning above.	3
551	531	Ultrafinitism is basically resource-bounded  constructivism: proofs have constructive content, and what you get out of these constructions isn't much more than you put in.Looking at the universal and existential quantifier should help clarify things.  Constructively, a universally quantified sentence means that if I am given a parameter, I can construct something that satisfies the quantified predicate.  Ultrafinitistically, the thing you give back won't be much bigger: typically there will be a polynomial bound on the size of what you get back.For existentially quantified statements, the constructive content is a pair of the value of the parameter, and the construction that satisfies the predicate.  Here the resource is the size of the proof: the size of the parameter and construction will be related to the size of the proof of the existential.Typically, addition and mutliplication are total functions, but exponentiation is not.  Self-verifying theories are more extreme: addition is total in the strongest of these theories, but multiplication cannot be.  So the resource bound is linear for these theories, not polynomial.A foundational problem with ultrafinitism is that there aren't nice ultrafinitist logics that support an attractive formulae-as-types correspondence in the way that intuitionistic logic does.  This makes ultrafinitism a less comfy kind of constructivism than intuitionism.Why do people believe it?  For the same kinds of reasons people believe in constructivism: they want mathematical claims to be backed up by something they can regard as concrete.  Just as an intuitionist might be bothered by the idea of cutting a ball into non-measurable pieces and putting them back together into two balls, so too  an ultrafinitist might be concerned about the idea that towers of exponentials are meaningful ways of constructing numbers.  Wittgenstein argued this point in his "Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics".Can you actually get math done from that perspective? Yes.  If intuitionism is the mathematics of the computable, ultrafinitism is the mathematics of the feasibly computable.  But the difference in ease of working with between ultrafinitism and intuitionism is much bigger than that between intuitionism and classical mathematics.	59
552	548	I think that ignoring limits is problematic. If there was a limit of the function $f(x,y)=x/y$ for $x,y \to 0$ regardless of how the limit is performed, then one would define that value to be $f(0,0)$, even if everything else is strange. Since the limiting value depends on the way the limit is done, choosing a value for $f(0,0)$ is counterproductive as it gives a non-continuous function. Better to have a continuous function over a slightly smaller domain. This also forces the point that if you do have a limit process that results in the evaluation of $f(0,0)$, you realize early on that you should examine the limit carefully rather than use $\lim g(x) = g(\lim x)$ (which is only true for continuous functions, of course.)By the way, this might be too trivial, but I'll give an example of how the limiting value depends on the limit:$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$, (both $\sin(x)$ and $x$ goto 0)$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos x - 1}{x} = 0$ (again, both num and denum goto 0, but num goes "faster")$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{x}}{x} =+\infty$.PS, sorry about the latex notation, hopefully, we could have it working nicely like in MO...	5
553	548	For "all" x,$$\frac0x = 0 \overset{?}{\implies} \frac00 = 0$$For "all" x,$$\frac x x = 1 \overset{?}{\implies} \frac00 = 1$$Moreover, if one could say $\frac00 = k, \forall k$, we could then say $2 = 3$ — just divide both sides by 0 and get $k = k$, which is patently true.Since there is no reasonable value $\frac00$ can have, $\frac00$ must be undefined.	17
554	536	I'll try it for 2D and then we can get 1D as a corollary [excercise!]...This is the only proof I know of, there may be a more intuitive (and less messy without tex!) proof out there, but I like this one- it uses generating functions in a really nifty way.Consider the probability of being at the origin after 2n steps (notice we cannot return in an odd number of steps):  $u_0=1$$u_{2n} = p(n,n,0,0)+ p(n-1,n-1,1,1)+...+p(n-k,n-k,k,k)+...+p(0,0,n,n)$ (when $n \neq 0) Here $p(u,d,l,r)$ is the probability of the first 2n steps being u up, d down, l left and r right in any order. Each order has probability $\frac{1}{4^{2n}}$, and there are $\frac{(2n)!}{u!d!l!r!}$ distinct orders, giving $p(n-k,n-k,k,k)=\frac{1}{4^{2n}} \frac{(2n)!}{(n-k)!(n-k)!k!k!}$Now, since $(2n)!=n! n! \binom{2n}{n}$ we have $p(n-k,n-k,k,k)=\frac{1}{4^{2n}} \binom{2n}{n} \binom{n}{k}^2$ giving$u_{2n}= \frac{1}{4^{2n}}  \Sigma_k \binom{2n}{n} \binom{n}{k}^2$ which, by one of those silly binomial results, can be contracted to  $u_{2n}= \frac{1}{4^{2n}} \binom{2n}{n}^2$Let us put that in our back pocket for now and consider in stead the probability of first returning after 2n steps $f_{2n}$- this is rather difficult to tackle directly but we can make ourselves a cunning little formula involving it, jazz out some generating function fun and seal the deal with some .The formula in question is:$u_{2n}= f_2 u_{2n-2}+ f_4 u_{2n-4} +....+f_{2n-2}u_{2} + f_{2n}$Which we shall not prove so much as explain: to return to the origin after 2n steps (LHS) you must either first return after 2 steps and do a 'return to the origin in 2n-2 steps walk' (first term RHS) or first return after 4 steps and do a 'return to the origin in 2n-4 steps walk' (2nd term) or... or first return after 2n-2 steps and do a 'return to the origin in 2 steps walk or first return to the origin after 2n steps.We shall now tweak our formula just a tiny bit so it has the right symmetry properties for what is to come, we do this by adding $f_0=0$ and $u_0=1$ to give   $u_{2n}= f_0 u_{2n}+ f_2 u_{2n-2}+ f_4 u_{2n-4} +....+f_{2n-2}u_{2} + f_{2n}u_0$Which is secretly a statement about generating functions (this is the sweet bit!), see look at the generating functions of u_n, f_n:$U(x)= \Sigma_m u_{2m} x^{2m}$, $F(x)= \Sigma_m f_{2m} x^{2m}$We see:  $U(x)= 1+ U(x)F(x)$(where the '1+' is to compensate for the fact that $u_0$ does not appear in the product) Rearranging to:$F(x)= \frac{U(x)-1}{U(x)}$Observe that the probability of return is $\Sigma f_n= F(1)$, which comes out as 1  because $U(1)$ diverges by some tedious stirlings formula bounds that I forget.Edit: Until Tex comes online, this is pretty unreadable, so here's a link to some lecture notes I found with the same proof (and, fortunately, the same notation!). Enjoy!Edit$^2$: Hooray, Tex has come online!!! Enjoy.	9
555	514	For an old example, Mersenne made the following conjecture in 1644:The Mersenne numbers, $M_n=2^n  − 1$, are prime for n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127 and 257, and no others.Euler observed that the Mersenne number at $M_{61}$ is prime, so refuting the conjecture.$M_{61}$ is quite large by the standards of the day: 2 305 843 009 213 693 951.According to Wikipedia, there are 47 known Mersenne primes.	25
556	540	Here there is another attempt at an explanation.We know that the sum of the inverse of the positive numbers, $1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + \cdots$, diverges. Euler shown that the sum of the inverse of the squares,  $1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + \cdots$, has a finite sum, namely $\pi^2/6$. Mathematicians love to generalize things, so they thought at the function$\displaystyle f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\dfrac1{n^x}$which is defined for $x \gt 1$. But this was not enough: they decided that the variable could be a complex number and not a real one. There is a standard tecnique (Analytic continuation) which allows us to extend the function to nearly all the complex plane. So we now have a function which formally is $\displaystyle \zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\dfrac1{n^s}$(the variable being $s$ and not $x$ to show that we are dealing with complex numbers) but is not computed in this way. Just to make an example, $\zeta(0)=-1/2$, and sum of an infinity of ones is not $-1/2$. :-) It may be shown that for $s = -2n$ ($n$ positive integer) $\zeta(s) = 0$. But there are infinite other point $s'=(x,y)$ where $\zeta(s') = 0$. For all of these points, $0 \lt x \lt 1$; Riemann's hypothesis says that for all such points $x = 1/2$. If it were true, we could have the best asymptotic expression to count $\pi(n)$, that is the number of primes below $n$.Why does the function pop up when we talk about primes? I don't know, but in the case of integer values Euler proved that $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac1{n^s}=\prod_{p \text{ prime}}\frac1{1-p^{-s}}$Maybe this could be a good start.	15

560	135	If we use the idea of set exponentiation to define exponentiation of cardinals, we have the following natural idea:$$A^B:=\{f:B\to A\}$$We define the exponential of cardinals as follows: $|A|^{|B|}:=|A^B|$.  It's easy to check that this agrees with our intuition for exponentiation of natural numbers when $B$ is nonempty.There is only one set representing the cardinal $0$, namely the empty set.  Then we may look at $0^0$ as follows: $$0^0=|\emptyset|^{|\emptyset|}=|\emptyset^\emptyset|  =|\{f:\emptyset\to\emptyset\}|=1$$	7
561	533	Quasi-coherent sheaves on affine schemes (say $Spec(A)$) are obtained by taking an $A$-module $M$ and the associated sheaf (by localizing $M$).  This gives an equivalence of categories between $A$-modules and q-c sheaves on $Spec(A)$.Let $R$ be a graded ring, $R = R_0 + R_1 + \dots$ (direct sum).  Then we can, given a graded $R$-module $M$, consider its associated sheaf $\tilde{M}$.  The stalk of this at  a homogeneous prime ideal $P$ is defined to be the localization $M_{(P)}$, which is defined as generated by quotients $m/s$ for $s$ homogeneous of the same degree as $m$ and not in $P$.  In short, we get sheaves of modules on the affine scheme just as we get the normal  sheaves of rings.  We get sheaves of modules on the projective scheme in the same homogeneous localization way as we get the sheaf of rings.However, it's no longer an equivalence of categories. Why? Say you had a graded module $M= M_0 + M_1 + \dots$ (in general, we allow negative gradings as well).  Then it is easy to check that the sheaves associated to $M$ and $M' = M_1 + M_2 + \dots$ are exactly the same.Nevertheless, it is possible to get every sheaf on $Proj(R)$ for $R$ a graded ring in this way.  See Proposition II.5.15 in Hartshorne.	10
562	530	If I'm not mistaken, the integral domain of holomorphic functions on a connected open set $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ works. It is a theorem (in Chapter 15 of Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis, and essentially a corollary of the Weierstrass factorization theorem), that every finitely generated ideal in this domain is principal. This implies that if $a,b$ have no common factor, they generate the unit ideal.  However, for instance, the ideal of holomorphic functions in the unit disk that vanish on all but finitely many of ${1-\frac{1}{n}}$ is nonprincipal.	11
563	536	See Durrett, Probability: Theory and Examples (link goes to online copy of the fourth edition).  On p. 164 Durrett gives a proof that simple random walk is recurrent in two dimensions.First find the probability that simple random walk in one dimension is at $0$ after $2n$ steps; this is clearly $\rho_1(2n) = \binom{2n}{n}/2^{2n}$, since $\binom{2n}{n}$ is the number of paths with $n$ right steps and $n$ left steps.Next, the probability that simple random walk in two dimensions -- call this $\rho_2(2n)$ -- is at $0$ after $2n$ steps is the square of the previous probability.  Consider the simple random walk which makes steps to the northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest with equal probability. The projections of this walk onto the x- and y-axes are independent simple random walks in one dimension. Rotating and rescaling gives the "usual" SRW in two dimensions (with steps north, east, south and west) and doesn't change the probability of being at $0$.So $\rho_2(2n) = \left(\binom{2n}{n}/2^{2n}\right)^2$.  This is asymptotic to $1/(\pi n)$, and the expected number of returns to the origin is the $\sum_{n \geq 1} \rho_2(2n)$, so the expected number of returns to the origin is infinite. It's not hard to show (and is in fact true, but the proof is unenlightening so I'll leave it to Durrett) that in this case the probability of eventually returning to the origin is $1$.	33
564	544	Markov chains, especially hidden Markov models are hugely important in computation linguistics. A hidden Markov model is one where we can't directly view the state, but we do have some information about what the state might be. For example, consider breaking down a sentence into what is called "parts of speech" such as verbs, adjectives, ect. We don't know what the parts of speech are, but we can attempt to deduce them from the word. For example, the word run might be used 80% as a verb, 18% of the time as a noun and 2% of the time as an adjective. We also have (Markov) relations between the parts of speech, so for example an adjective might be followed by a noun 70% of the time and another adjective 30% of the time.We can use the Viterbi algorithm to decide which sequence is most likely to have generated the observed sentence. This algorithm takes into account two factors:the probability of such a sequence of parts of speech occurring together in a sentencethe relative chance that such a sequence of parts of speech would be responsible for us observing the given sentence.	7
565	534	This is close to being the flipside of the geometric mean, which is the nth root of the product of the numbers, and can be expressed as the exponential of the sum of the logarithms.  Another pair of dual mean measures is the regular mean and the harmonic mean (n divided by the sum of the reciprocals).I say the soft maximum is close to being the flipside of the geometric mean, but it lacks the good property that all of the others have of taking a list of the same value to that value (for definedness, let all values be positive).  Let's call the hyperbolic mean the "soft maximum" of the nth roots of the terms in the list: then this has that good property.The hyperbolic mean the emphasises large values in a roughly symmetric manner to the way that the geometric mean emphasises small values (which is always smaller than the regular mean), and is, of course, much smaller for long list of large values.So I say, consider it an amplified version of a useful addition to the family of of mean operators.	3

571	What is the optimum angle of projection when throwing a stone off a cliff?	You are standing on a cliff at a height $h$ above the sea. You are capable of throwing a stone with velocity $v$ at any angle $a$ between horizontal and vertical. What is the value of $a$ when the horizontal distance travelled $d$ is at a maximum?On level ground, when $h$ is zero, it's easy to show that $a$ needs to be midway between horizontal and vertical, and thus $\large\frac{\pi}{4}$ or $45°$. As $h$ increases, however, we can see by heuristic reasoning that $a$ decreases to zero, because you can put more of the velocity into the horizontal component as the height of the cliff begins to make up for the loss in the vertical component. For small negative values of $h$ (throwing up onto a platform), $a$ will actually be greater than $45°$.Is there a fully-solved, closed-form expression for the value of $a$ when $h$ is not zero?	10

I originally tried solving the quadratic for $t$ and subbing that into $x$, but it seems to work much better to do the substitution the other way round. I will leave this solution here in case anyone wants to see how to derive the basic equations for $x$ and $y$.	0
577	Has anyone ever proposed additional axioms?	According to Wikipedia, Godel's incompleteness theorem states:  No consistent system of axioms whose  theorems can be listed by an  "effective procedure" (essentially, a  computer program) is capable of  proving all facts about the natural  numbers.This obviously includes our current system. So has anyone proposed any additional axioms that seem credible?	8
578	571	Assume no friction and uniform gravity g. If you throw a stone at point (0, h), with velocity (v cos θ, v sin θ), then we get\begin{align}d &= vt\cos\theta && (1) \\0 &= h + vt\sin\theta - \frac12 gt^2 && (2)\end{align}The only unknown to be solved is t (total travel time). We could eliminate it by using $t = \frac d{v\cos\theta}$ to get$$ 0 = h + d\tan\theta - \frac{gd^2\sec^2\theta}{2v^2}\qquad(3) $$Then we compute the total derivative with respect to θ:\begin{align}0 &= \frac d{d\theta}\left(d\tan\theta\right) - \frac g{2v^2}\frac d{d\theta}\left(d^2\sec^2\theta\right) \\&= \ldots\end{align}and then set $\frac{dd}{d\theta}=0$ (because it is maximum) to solve d:$$ d = \frac{v^2}{g\tan\theta} $$Substitute this back to (3) gives:\begin{align}h &= \frac{v^2}g \left( \frac1{2\sin^2\theta} - 1\right) \\\Rightarrow \sin\theta &= \left( 2 \left(\frac{gh}{v^2} + 1\right) \right)^{-1/2}\end{align}This is the closed form of θ in terms of h. 	12
579	573	Edited to clear some things up:Simplicial and singular (co)homology were invented to detect holes in spaces.  To get an intuitive idea of how this works, consider subspaces of the plane.  Here the 2-chains are formal sums of things homeomorphic to the closed disk, and 1-chains are formal sums of things homeomorphic to a line segment.  The operator d takes the boundary of a chain.  For example, the boundary of the closed disk is a circle.  If we take d of the circle we get $0$ since a circle has no boundary.  And in general it happens that $d^2 = 0$, that is boundaries always have no boundaries themselves.  Now suppose we remove the origin from the plane and take a circle around the origin.  This circle is in the kernel of d since it has no boundary.  However, it does not bound any 2-chain in the space (since the origin is removed) and so it is not in the image of the boundary operator on two-dimensions.  Thus the circle represents a non-trivial element in the quotient space $ker( d ) / im (d)$.The way I have defined things makes the above a homology theory simply because the d operator decreases dimension.  Cohomology is the same thing only the operator increases dimension (for example the exterior derivative on differential forms).  Thus algebraically there really is no difference between cohomology and homology since we can just change the grading from $i$ to $-i$.  From a homology we can get a corresponding cohomology theory by dualizing, that is by looking at maps from the group of chains to the underlying group (e.g. $\Bbb Z$ or $\Bbb R$).  Then d on the cohomology theory becomes the adjoint of the previous boundary operator and thus increases degrees.	7

586	107	I've always thought this sort of puzzle is a wonderful example of the difference between behaviour as you approach a limit, versus behaviour AT the limit.You can make the puzzle more revealing like this:Say I have an infinite number of banknotes, each with a unique serial number. I give you bill number 1.Now, you have two options, either you keep that bill and the game ends, or I give you 10 more banknotes, but you have to burn the lowest numbered bill. It seems obvious that option two is much better.Now, we repeat this game over and over. You keep getting more and more money.But at the limit, every banknote has been burned and you're worse off than you would have been had you just taken the one banknote and left.	7
587	577	Adding additional axioms would make more truths provable. But it wouldn't make all truths provable (unless the axiom was inconsistent with the already given ones, in which case all falsehoods would also be provable too).So adding additional axioms isn't going to help make all the truths provable. I guess you could just add, say, Goldbach's conjecture and the Riemann hypothesis as extra axioms and carry on doing mathematics-PLUS! but why would you want to?	5
589	588	This is a very general question, as one can create all sorts of power series for different functions. (e.g. Taylor series, Laurent series, Fourier series).To give the obvious example of Taylor series: a power series representation of a function can be found if the function is infinitely differentiable in the neighbourhood of the given point.With all power series, you will need to find the recursion relation (formula giving a successive term from the current term) and then use the ratio test to solve for the value of the input variable that gives a ratio of convergence of 1.	-1
590	540	The key point is that the Riemann zeta function is a function whose properties encode properties about the prime numbers.  As mentioned by Noldorin, in order to fully understand the Riemann zeta function you need to "analytically continue it to the complex plane" which is a tricky process which takes serious study.  Fortunately for some easier properties of the primes you can just use the definition of the zeta function for real s.Claim (due to Euler): The fact that $\zeta(s)$ goes to infinity as s->1 tells you that there are infinitely many primes.Sketch of proof: Use the "Euler factorization" mentioned by mau (expand the RHS as a geometric series and then multiply it out using unique factorization into primes):$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1} {n^s} = \prod_{p\in\text{prime}} \frac{1} {1-p^-s}$Now take log of both sides to get:$\displaystyle\log \zeta(s) = \sum_{p\in\text{prime}} \log \frac{1} {1-p^-s}.$Now use the taylor series for \log and send s to one.  You'll get that the left hand side goes to infinity (Why does the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac1n$ not converge?), while the right hand side looks like $\sum 1/p$ + bounded terms.  So there must be infinitely many primes.	9
591	588	A function can be represented as a power series if and only if it is complex differentiable in an open set. This follows from the general form of Taylor's theorem for complex functions.Being real differentiable--even infinitely many times--is not enough, as the function $e^{-1/x^2}$ on the real line (equal to 0 at 0) is $C^\infty$ yet does not equal its power series expansion since all its derivatives at zero vanish. The reason is that the complexified version of the function is not even continuous at the origin.	21
592	577	Sure, the continuum hypothesis.  We know, thanks to the work of Godel and Paul Cohen, that this is a legitimate axiom, in that it doesn't destroy consistency: you can't disprove it (or prove it) using Zermelo-Frank set theory. People do actually use the continuum hypothesis in model theory, for instance, where there are several results that depend on it.  For an article about its uses, cf. the Tricki page.	4
593	Is there a relationship between $e$ and the sum of $n$-simplexes volumes?

Does anyone know of a stronger relationship beyond, "they sort of look similar"?

595	What is the most efficient way to determine if a matrix is invertible?	I'm learning Linear Algebra using MIT's Open Courseware Course 18.06Quite often, the professor says "... assuming that the matrix is invertible ...".Somewhere in the lecture he says that using a determinant on an $n \times n$ matrix is on the order of $O(n!)$ operations, where an operation is a multiplication and a subtraction.Is there a more efficient way?  If the aim is to get the inverse, rather than just determine the invertibility, what is the most effecient way to do this?	13
596	595	Gauss-Jordan elimination can be used to determine when a matrix is invertible and can be done in polynomial (in fact, cubic) time.  The same method (when you apply the opposite row operation to identity matrix) works to calculate the inverse in polynomial time as wel.	14

Result is the symmetry group of the tiling of the hyperbolic plane. From this description one can see that G is infinite (e.g. because there are infinitely many triangles in the tiling and G acts on them transitively).	19
598	594	Let $p$ be a prime congruent to 1 mod 4. Then to write $p = x^2 + y^2$ for $x,y$ integers is the same as writing $p = (x+iy)(x-iy) = N(x+iy)$ for $N$ the norm.  It is well-known that the ring of Gaussian integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a principal ideal domain, even a euclidean domain.   Now I claim that $p$ is not prime in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. To determine how a prime $p$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ splits in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is equivalent to determining how the polynomial $X^2+1$ splits modulo $p$.  First off, $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ because $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$.  Consequently, there is $t \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $t^2 \equiv -1 \mod p$, so $X^2+1$ splits modulo $p$, and $p$ does not remain prime in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.  (Another way of seeing this is to note thatif $p$ remained prime, then we'd have $p \mid (t+i)(t-i)$, which means that $p \mid t+i$ or $t \mid t-i$.)Anyway, as a result there is a non-unit $x+iy$ of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ that properly divides $p$.  This means that the norms properly divide as well.  In particular, $N(x+iy) = x^2+y^2$ properly divides $p^2$, so is $p$ or $1$. It cannot be the latter since otherwise $x+iy$ would be a unit.  So $x^2+y^2 = p$.	18

600	Circular permutations with indistinguishable objects	Given n distinct objects, there are $n!$ permutations of the objects and $n!/n$ "circular permutations" of the objects (orientation of the circle matters, but there is no starting point, so $1234$ and $2341$ are the same, but $4321$ is different).Given $n$ objects of $k$ types (where the objects within each type are indistinguishable), $r_i$ of the $i^{th}$ type, there are \begin{equation*}\frac{n!}{r_1!r_2!\cdots r_k!}\end{equation*}permutations.  How many circular permutations are there of such a set?	14
601	Counting how many hands of cards use all four suits	From a standard 52-card deck, how many ways are there to pick a hand of $k$ cards that includes one card from all four suits?I know that for any specific $k$, it's possible to break it up into cases based on the partitions of $k$ into four parts. For example, if I want to choose a hand of six cards, I can break it up into two cases based on whether there are (1) three cards from one suit and one card from each of the other three or (2) two cards from each of two suits and one card from each of the other two.Is there a simpler, more general solution that doesn't require splitting the problem into many different cases?	10
602	601	Count the number of hands that do not contain at least one card from every suit and subtract from the total number of k-card hands.  To count the number of hands that do not contain at least one card from every suit, use inclusion-exclusion considering what suits are not in a given hand.  That is, letting $N(\dots)$ mean the number of hands meeting the given criteria, $$\begin{align}&N(\mathrm{no\ }\heartsuit)+N(\mathrm{no\ }\spadesuit)+N(\mathrm{no\ }\clubsuit)+N(\mathrm{no\ }\diamondsuit)\\&\quad\quad-N(\mathrm{no\ }\heartsuit\spadesuit)-N(\mathrm{no\ }\heartsuit\clubsuit)-N(\mathrm{no\ }\heartsuit\diamondsuit)-N(\mathrm{no\ }\spadesuit\clubsuit)-N(\mathrm{no\ }\spadesuit\diamondsuit)-N(\mathrm{no\ }\clubsuit\diamondsuit)\\&\quad\quad+N(\mathrm{no\ }\heartsuit\spadesuit\clubsuit)+N(\mathrm{no\ }\heartsuit\spadesuit\diamondsuit)+N(\mathrm{no\ }\heartsuit\clubsuit\diamondsuit)+N(\mathrm{no\ }\spadesuit\clubsuit\diamondsuit)\\&\quad\quad-N(\mathrm{no\ }\heartsuit\spadesuit\clubsuit\diamondsuit)\\&=4{39 \choose k}-6{26 \choose k}+4{13 \choose k}-{0 \choose k}.\end{align}$$So, the number of hands of k cards that include at least one card from every suit is $${52 \choose k}-4{39 \choose k}+6{26 \choose k}-4{13 \choose k}+{0 \choose k}.$$  [Drop terms as appropriate for larger values of k.]	8
603	What transformations of the plane are geometrically constructable (compass & straight edge)?	Congruence transformations (isometries) and similarity transformations (isometries + dilations) should be constructable.  What about other affine transformations?  Other conformal mappings?edit: by constructable, I mean given the defining information for the transformation in a geometric way (e.g. a dilation requires a center and a ratio, so the given could be a point and two segments), can you construct the image of a point under the transformation from its preimage?	5
604	Why does the log-log scale on my Slide Rule work?	For a long time I've eschewed bulky and inelegant calculators for the use of my trusty trig/log-log slide rule.  For those unfamiliar, here is a simple slide rule simulator using Javascript.To demonstrate, find the $LL_3$ scale, which is on the back of the virtual one.  Let's say we want to solve  $3^n$.First, you would move the cursor (the red line) over where $3$ is on the $LL_3$ scale.  Then, you would slide the middle slider until the $1$ on the $C$ scale is lined up to the cursor.And voila, your slide rule is set up to find $3^n$ for any arbitrary $n$.   For example, to find $3^2$, move the cursor to $2$ on the $C$ scale, and your answer is what the cursor is on on the $LL_3$ scale ($9$).  Move your cursor to $3$ on $C$, and it should be lined up with $27$ on $LL_3$.  To $4$ on C, it is on $81$ on $LL_3$.You can even do this for non-integer exponents ($1.3,\cdots$ etc.)You can also do this for exponents less than one, by using the $LL_2$ scale.  For example, to do $3^{0.5}$, you would find $5$ on the $C$ scale, and look where the cursor is lined up at on the $LL_2$ scale (which is about $1.732$).Anyways, I was wondering if anyone could explain to me how this all works?  It works, but...why?  What property of logarithms and exponents (and logarithms of logarithms?) allows this to work?I already understand how the basics of the Slide Rule works ($\ln(m) + \ln(n) = \ln(mn)$), with only multiplication, but this exponentiation eludes me.	12
605	604	If x = 3n, then log x = n log 3.The C scale is logarithmic, which means if the reading is p, then the distance is proportional to   log p.Similarly, in the LLx scale the distance is proportional to   log log p.Thus, when you align 1 to "3" in LL3, you introduce an offset of (log log 3). Suppose you get a reading of n in the C scale, then the corresponding value in LL3 would be:log log p = log log 3 + log n  (LL3)      (offset)    (C)eliminating one level of log gives    log p = log 3 * neliminating one more level of log gives        p = 3^nLL2 is the same as LL3 except it covers a different range.	7
606	519	Grigory has already answered your particular question.

607	Given enough time, what are the chances I can come out ahead in a coin toss contest?	Assuming I can play forever, what are my chances of coming out ahead in a coin flipping series?Let's say I want "heads"...then if I flip once, and get heads, then I win, because I've reached a point where I have more heads than tails (1-0).  If it was tails, I can flip again.  If I'm lucky, and I get two heads in a row after this, this is another way for me to win (2-1).Obviously, if I can play forever, my chances are probably pretty decent.  They are at least greater than 50%, since I can get that from the first flip.  After that, though, it starts getting sticky.I've drawn a tree graph to try to get to the point where I could start see the formula hopefully dropping out, but so far it's eluding me.Your chances of coming out ahead after 1 flip are 50%.  Fine.  Assuming you don't win, you have to flip at least twice more.  This step gives you 1 chance out of 4.  The next level would be after 5 flips, where you have an addtional 2 chances out of 12, followed by 7 flips, giving you 4 out of 40.I suspect I may be able to work through this given some time, but I'd like to see what other people think...is there an easy way to approach this?  Is this a known problem?	6
608	607	100%, for the same reason as the 1-D walkIn fact (again for the same reason), your chances are 100% of eventually reaching X-greater heads than tails (or tails than heads), where X is any non-negative integer.	19

612	What are some applications outside of mathematics for algebraic geometry?	Are there any results from algebraic geometry that have led to an interesting "real world" application? 	18
613	612	Broadly speaking, algebraic geometry is used a lot in some areas of robotics and mechanical engineering. Real algebraic geometry, for example, is important to the development of CAD systems (think NURBS, computing intersections of primitives, etc.) And AG comes up in robotics when it is important to figure out, say, what motions a robotic arm in a given configuration is capable of, or to construct some kind of linkage that draws a prescribed curve.Something specific in that vein: Kempe's Universality Theorem gives that any bounded algebraic curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the locus of some linkage. The "locus of a linkage" being the path drawn out by all the vertices of a graph, where the edge lengths are all specified and one or more vertices remains still.Interestingly, Kempe's orginal proof of the theorem was flawed, and more recent proofs have been more involved. However, Timothy Abbott's MIT masters thesis gives a simpler proof that gives a working linkage for a given curve, and makes for interesting reading concerning the problem in general.Edit: The NURBS connection is, in part, that can construct a B-spline that approximates a given real algebraic curve, which is crucial in displaying intersection curves, for example. See here for more details (I'm afraid I don't know many on this.)	11
614	How to determine annual payments on a partially repaid loan?	  A 10-year loan of $500 is repaid with  payments at the end of each year. The lender charges interest at an  annual effective rate of 10%.   Each of the first ten payments is  150% of the amount of interest due.   Each of the last ten payments is X.   Calculate X.I came across this practice question while studying for my actuary exam. I tried it on my own and got stuck:$\$ $500 will earn $\$ $50 interest each year, so each of the first 10 payments must be $\$ $75.  Then after 10 years, a total of 750 has been repaid.In 10 years, I can find the accumulated debt by saying PV=500, I/Y=10, N=10, giving me FV=$\$ $1296.87. So the balance would be $\$ $1296.87-$\$ $750=$\$ $546.97.  Now I am stuck! How do I find out what the last payments should be? I know I can't just divide $\$ $546.97/10=$\$ $54.697, because the lender is still charging interest while the borrower pays off this remaining debt, so there would still be the interest left over.This situation isn't mentioned anywhere in my calculator manual! Can one of you give me some explanation about what is going on so that I can do it by hand?I tried working on it some more, and came up with a really great idea! Since the payments are 1.5x the 10% interest, it's just like paying off 5% of the principal each year! This saves me a lot of time, because I can just set I/Y=-5 and get FV=598.74 on my calculator. I did it the long way by calculating the future value of each interest payment (turns out they were not all $75, because the outstanding principal got smaller), and they were the same. Is this always going to work, or did I just get lucky here?  Another update!I think I solved it. All I needed to do was to set FV=0, I/Y=10, N=10, PV=598.74, and then I got PMT=97.44. I never used the PMT button before, though, so is there some other way I can check the answer is right?	5
615	612	The following slideshow gives an explanation of how algebraic geometry can be used in phylogenetics.See also this post of Charles Siegel on Rigorous Trivialties. This is not an area I've looked at in much detail at all, but it appears that the idea is to use a graph to model evolutionary processes, and such that the "transition function" for these processes is given by a polynomial map.  In particular, it'd be of interest to look at the potential outcomes, namely the image of the transition function; that corresponds to the image of a polynomial map (which is not necessarily an algebraic variety, but it is a constructible set, so not that badly behaved either).  (In practice, though, it seems that one studies the closure, which is a legitimate algebraic set.)	7
616	614	This problem is in two stages. For the first stage, notice that you are paying 150% interest, but ending up owing more. This is because you subtracted $\$ $750 from the future value, when in fact each $\$ $75 amount was paid at a time in the past and needs be converted to a future value too. The payment in the nth year has a future value of $75\times(1.1)^{10-n}$. The total future value of the repayment is:$$75(1.1^9)+75(1.1^8)+\cdots+75(1.1^0).$$Note that I have assumed that the interest is charged before the repayments are made. This sequence is a geometric progression. We consider it as a geometric sequence in reverse to make the maths easier. It has first term ($a$) 75, each term 1.1 times the previous ($r$) and 10 terms ($n$). The sum is given by the formula:$$\frac{a{r^{n-1}}}{r-1}=\frac{75{1.1^{10-1}}}{0.1}\approx\$1195.31$$After we have solved this first part, then it is just a standard interest with repayments problem.. 	5
617	607	The question can be answered using Catalan numbers. Let C_n denote the number of sequences of 2n coin tosses in which you are never ahead. Formally, we count sequences in which every prefix has no less T's than H's. We call this property A.The number of total sequences of length 2n is $2^{2n}$. We then show that as n→∞, the ratio $C_n / 2^{2n}$ tends to 0. This means that in almost every sequence you will eventually be ahead (the chances of a random sequence having property A tend to 0 as the sequence gets longer).Indeed,$C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!}$so$C_n / 2^{2n} = \frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}} \cdot \frac{1}{(n+1)!n!}$and it can be shown that this tends to 0 by Stirling's approximation (multiply and divide by $(2n/e)^{2n}$).	6
618	Repayments of a loan with compound interest	Suppose I have a loan of M dollars. At the end of each year, I am charged interest at rate R and make a repayment of P. The loan is repaid after n years.How long (n) does it take to repay the loan if I am given the other variables?How much are the repayments of P if I am given the other variable?Suppose that the payments were at the start of the year. How would this change the problem?	3
619	Problem: Two Trains and a Fly	The Problem:Two trains travel on the same track towards each other, each going at a speed of 50 kph. They start out 50km apart. A fly starts at the front of one train and flies at 75 kph to the front of the other; when it gets there, it turns around and flies back towards the first. It continues flying back and forth til the two trains meet and it gets squashed (the least of our worries, perhaps).How far did the fly travel before it got squashed?Attempt at a solution:I can do this by summing the infinite series of the fly's distance for each leg. I get an answer of 37.5 km: but that's so nice! There must be a more intuitive way...is there?	11
620	619	The trains take half an hour to collide, which, at a rate of 75kph, leads to the fly travelling 37.5km.	12

623	Why is the volume of a cone one third of the volume of a cylinder?	The volume of a cone with height $h$ and radius $r$ is $\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$, which is exactly one third the volume of the smallest cylinder that it fits inside.This can be proved easily by considering a cone as a solid of revolution, but I would like to know if it can be proved or at least visual demonstrated without using calculus.	60
624	Balance chemical equations without trial and error?	In my AP chemistry class, I often have to balance chemical equations like the following:$$ \mathrm{Al} + \text O_2 \to \mathrm{Al}_2 \mathrm O_3 $$The goal is to make both side of the arrow have the same amount of atoms by adding compounds in the equation to each side.A solution:$$ 4 \mathrm{Al} + 3 \mathrm{ O_2} \to 2 \mathrm{Al}_2 \mathrm{ O_3} $$When the subscripts become really large, or there are a lot of atoms involved, trial and error is impossible unless performed by a computer. What if some chemical equation can not be balanced?  (Do such equations exist?) I tried one for a long time only to realize the problem was wrong.My teacher said trial and error is the only way. Are there other methods?	23
626	622	The representation theory of finite groups can be used to prove results about finite groups themselves that are otherwise much harder to prove by "elementary" means. For instance, the proof of Burnside's theorem (that a group of order $p^a q^b$ is solvable).  A lot of the classification proof of finite simple groups relies on representation theory (or so I'm told, I haven't read the proof...).Mathematical physics. Lie algebras and Lie groups definitely come up here, but I'm not familiar enough to explain anything. In addition, the classification of complex simple Lie algebras relies on the root space decomposition, which is a significant (and nontrivial) fact about the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras.Number theory.  The nonabelian version of L-functions (Artin L-functions) rely on the representations of the Galois group (in the abelian case, these just correspond to sums of 1-dimensional characters).  For instance, the proof that Artin L-functions are meromorphic in the whole plane relies on (I think) Artin Brauer's theorem (i.e., a corollary of the usual statement) that any irreducible character is an rational integer combination of induced characters from cyclic subgroups -- this is in Serre's Linear Representations of Finite Groups. Also, the Langlands program studies  representations of groups $GL_n(\mathbb{A}_K)$ for $\mathbb{A}_K$ the adele ring of a global field. This is a generalization of standard "abelian" class field theory (when $n=1$ and one is determining the character group of the ideles).Combinatorics. The representation theory of the symmetric group has a lot of connections to combinatorics, because you can parametrize the irreducibles explicitly (via Young diagrams), and this leads to the problem of determining how these Young diagrams interact. For instance, what does the tensor product of two Young diagrams look like when decomposed as a sum of Young diagrams? What is the dimension of the irreducible representation associated to a Young diagram? These problems have a combinatorial flavor.I should add the disclaimer that I have not formally studied representation theory, and these are likely to be an unrepresentative sample of topics (some of which I have only vaguely heard about).	31
627	625	Because you use the integral (read: anti-derivative) to find the area under the curve - even a curve in polar coordinates.	-2
628	625	Consider increasing the radius of a circle by an infinitesimally small amount, $dr$. This increases the area by an annulus (or ring) with inner radius $2 \pi r$ and outer radius $2\pi(r+dr)$. At this ring is extremely thin, we can imagine cutting the ring and then flattening it out to form a rectangle with width $2\pi r$ and height $dr$ (the side of length $2\pi(r+dr)$ is close enough to $2\pi r$ that we can ignore that). So the area gain is $2\pi r\cdot dr$ and to determine the rate of change with respect to $r$, we divide by $dr$ and so we get $2\pi r$. Please note that this is just an informative, intuitive explanation as opposed to a formal proof. The same reasoning works with a sphere, we just flatten it out to a rectangular prism instead.	32
629	624	Yes; it's possible to write a system of equations that can be solved to find the correct coefficients. Here's an example for the given formula.We're trying to find coefficients A, B, and C such that$A (\mathrm{Al}) + B (\mathrm{O_2}) \rightarrow C (\mathrm{Al_2 O_3})$In order to do this, we can write an equation for each element based on how many atoms are on each side of the equation.for Al: $A = 2C$for O: $2B = 3C$This is an uninteresting example, but these will always be linear equations in terms of the coefficients. Note that we have fewer equations than variables. This means that there's more than one way to correctly balance the equation (and there is, because any set of coefficients can be scaled by any factor). We just need to find one integral solution to these equations.To solve, we can arbitrarily set one of the variables to 1 and we'll get a solution with (probably fractional) coefficients. If we add $A=1$, the solution is $(A,B,C) = (1,\frac{3}{4},\frac{1}{2})$. To get the smallest solution with integer coefficients, just multiply by the least common multiple of the denominators ($4$ in this case), giving us $(4,3,2)$.If the set of equations has no solution where the coefficients are nonzero, then you know that the equation cannot be balanced.	18
632	Validating a mathematical model (Lagrange formulation and geometry)	I am working on computing phase diagrams for alloys.  These areblueprints for a material that show what phase, or combination ofphases, a material will exist in for a range of concentrations andtemperatures (see thispdf presentation).  The crucial step in drawing the boundaries that separate one phasefrom another on these diagrams involves minimizing a free energyfunction subject to basic physical conservation constraints.  I amgoing to leave out the chemistry/physics and hope that we can move forwardwith the minimization using Lagrange multipliers. The free energy that is to be minimized is this:$\widetilde{G}(x_1, x_2) = f^{(1)}G_{1}(x_1) + f^{(2)}G_{2}(x_2),$subject to:$f^{(1)}x_1 + f^{(2)}x_2 = c_1,$$f^{(1)} + f^{(2)} = 1. $(and also that the $x_{i} > 0$ and $f^{(i)} > 0$, for $i=1,2$.)The Lagrange formulation is:$L(x_1,x_2,f^{(1)},f^{(2)},\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3) =f^{(1)}G_{1}(x_1) + f^{(2)}G_{2}(x_2)$  $- \lambda_{1}(f^{(1)}x_1 + f^{(2)}x_2 - c_1)$$- \lambda_{2}(f^{(1)} + f^{(2)} - 1) $The minimization of $\widetilde{G}$ follows from finding the $x_{i}$'s  that satisfy $\nabla L = 0:$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}   = f^{(1)}G_{1}'(x_1) - \lambda_{1}f^{(1)} = 0$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_2}     = f^{(2)}G_{2}'(x_2) - \lambda_{1}f^{(2)} = 0$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial f^{(1)}} = G_{1}(x_1) - \lambda_{1}x_{1} - \lambda_2 = 0$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial f^{(2)}} = G_{2}(x_2) - \lambda_{1}x_{2} - \lambda_2 = 0$which yields:$(*) f^{(1)}\left[G_{1}'(x_1) - \lambda_1 \right] = 0$       $(**) f^{(2)}\left[G_{2}'(x_2) - \lambda_1 \right]= 0 $       $(\***) G_{1}(x_1) - G_{2}(x_2) = \lambda_1 \left[ x_1 - x_2\right]$ Because $f^{(1)}$ and $f^{(2)}$ are not to be zero, from (*) and (**) we have that $G_{1}'(x_1) = G_{2}'(x_2) = \lambda_{1}.$And, a manipulation of equation (***) looks like $\frac{G_{1}(x_1) -G_{2}(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2} = \lambda_{1}.$Now, think of $G_{i}$ as an even degree polynomial (which it isn't, butit's graph sometimes resembles one) in the plane.  Let the points $x_1$and $x_2$ be locations along the x-axis that lie roughly below theminima of this curve.  The constraints (*),(**), and (***) describe thecondition that the line drawn between $(x_1,G_{1}(x_1))$ and $(x_2,G_{2}(x_2))$ form a common tangentto the "wells" of the curve.  It is these points $x_1$ and $x_2$,which represent concentrations of pure components in our alloy, thatbecome mapped onto a phase diagram.  It is essentially by repeating this procedure for manytemperatures that we can trace out the boundaries in the desired phase diagram.The question is:  Looking at this from a purely analytic geometryperspective, how would one derive the "variational" approach to find a common tangent line that we seem to have found using the above Lagrangian?  (warning: I don't really know how tomodel things using variational methods.)  And, secondly: I have presented a model of a binary alloy, meaningtwo variables to keep track of representing concentrations.  I havebeen working on ternary alloys, where this free energy $\widetilde{G}$is a function of three variables (two independent: $x_1,x_2,x_3$,where $x_3 = 1- x_1 - x_2$) and is therefore a surface over a Gibbstriangle.  Then $\nabla L = 0$ produces partial derivatives that nolonger "speak geometry" to me, although the solution is a common tangentplane.  (I have attempted to characterize a common tangent planebased purely in analytic geometry - completely disregarding theLagrangian - and have come up with several relations betweendirectional derivatives... How might directional derivatives relateto the optimality conditions set forth by the Lagrangian?)EDIT:  Thank you Greg Graviton for wading through this sub-optimal notation and pointing out several mistakes in the statement of the problem.  (Also, thank you for the excellent discussion below.)	6
633	623	You can use Pappus's centroid theorem as in my answer here, but it does not provide much insight.If instead of a cylinder and a cone, you consider a cube and a square-based pyramid where the "top" vertex of the pyramid (the one opposite the square base) is shifted to be directly above one vertex of the base, you can fit three such pyramids together to form the complete cube.  (I've seen this as physical toy/puzzle with three pyramidal pieces and a cubic container.)  This may give some insight into the 1/3 "pointy thing rule" (for pointy things with similar, linearly-related cross-sections) that Katie Banks discussed in her comment.	1
634	603	edit (2010-07-26): The question is much more involved than I'd originally thought.  As implied in the question, I knew that congruence and similarity transformations are constructible.  Immediately below this section is my original answer, which only demonstrates congruence transformations and was intended more to give an idea of what an answer might look like (since, at the time, there was another answer that was not particularly helpful).  In the last section of this answer is my justification that all affine transformations of the plane are constructible.  In re-reading that now, I realize that I'd assumed the ability to construct a point, say $P'$, on a line, say $\overleftrightarrow{RP}$, such that $\frac{RP'}{RP}$ is equal to some known ratio.  This is equivalent to being able to construct the dilation of $P$ by the known ratio about center $R$.  I've added the construction of such a dilation below the congruence transformation section.edit (2012-01-28):  A conversation with some colleagues reminded me about this problem and in starting to ask them about it, I realized I'd completely missed that all Möbius transformations are constructible.  Since any Möbius transformation can be expressed as a composition of translation, reflection, inversion, dilation, rotation, and translation (I think there's a typical decomposition that's roughly in that order, hence my listing translation twice).  The only one of these that I have not yet shown is constructible is inversion, so I have appended that construction.As a partial answer, here are constructions of the basic congruence transformations, assuming basic construction techniques like constructing a line parallel or perpendicular to a given line through a given point and angle-copying:reflection  Given a point $P$ and a line $\ell$, construct the line perpendicular to $\ell$ through $P$, and construct the circle centered at the intersection of this new line and $\ell$ and passing through $P$.  The image of $P$ under a reflection over the line $\ell$ is the point of intersection of the circle and the new line (the one not at $P$).translation  Given a point $P$ and a vector $\overrightarrow{AB}$ (from $A$ to $B$), construct the line through $A$ and $P$, the line through $B$ parallel to line $\overleftrightarrow{PA}$, and the line through $P$ parallel to $\overrightarrow{AB}$.  The image of $P$ under translation by vector $\overrightarrow{AB}$ is the intersection of the two constructed parallels.rotation  Given a point $P$, a center of rotation $R$, and an $\angle ABC$ (from $A$ to $C$), construct the line through $P$ and $R$, copy $\angle ABC$ such that the copy of $B$ coincides with $R$ and the copy of $A$ is on ray $\overrightarrow{RP}$ and let the copy of $C$ be called $D$, construct the circle with center at $R$ and passing through $P$.  The image of $P$ under rotation by $\angle ABC$ about point $R$ is the intersection of the circle with ray $\overrightarrow{RD}$.dilation Given a point $P$, a center of dilation $R$, and a ratio $\frac{AC}{AB}$ (where point $C$ lies on ray $\overrightarrow{AB}$), translate $B$ to $B'$ and $C$ to $C'$ by the translation that takes $A$ to $R$, construct line $\overleftrightarrow{B'P}$, construct the line through $C'$ parallel to $\overleftrightarrow{B'P}$, and construct ray $\overrightarrow{RP}$.  The image of $P$ under a dilation about $R$ by a factor of $\frac{AC}{AB}$ is the intersection of ray $\overrightarrow{RP}$ and the line through $C'$ parallel to $\overleftrightarrow{B'P}$.All affine transformations are constructible.  Per MathWorld and Wikipedia, an affine transformation of the plane is a transformation of the plane that preserves collinearity and preserves ratios of distances on any given line.First, to show that affine transformations preserve parallelism, suppose that two lines $\overleftrightarrow{MN}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$ are parallel, and that their images, lines $\overleftrightarrow{M'N'}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{P'Q'}$, intersect at $X'$, the image of $X$.  Since affine transformations preserve collinearity, $X$ must be on $\overleftrightarrow{MN}$ and on $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$, which is a contradiction, so $\overleftrightarrow{M'N'}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{P'Q'}$ cannot intersect.  Thus, affine transformations preserve parallelism.An affine transformation is determined by a $\triangle ABC$ and its image, $\triangle A'B'C'$ (per MathWorld; Wikipedia talks about defining an affine transformation by a parallelogram and its image, which is equivalent since affine transformations preserve parallelism).  Given point $P$ and triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A'B'C'$, construct line $\ell_1$ through $P$ parallel to $\overline{AB}$ and line $\ell_2$ through $P$ and parallel to $\overline{AC}$, call the intersection of $\ell_1$ with $\overline{AC}$ $I_1$ and call the intersection of $\ell_2$ with $\overline{AB}$ $I_2$, extend $\overline{A'B'}$ past $B'$ to a point $I'_2$ such that $\frac{AB}{AI_2}=\frac{A'B'}{A'I'_2}$, extend $\overline{A'C'}$ past $C'$ to a point $I'_1$ such that $\frac{AC}{AI_1}=\frac{A'C'}{A'I'_1}$, construct line $\ell'_1$ through $I'_1$ parallel to $\overline{A'B'}$ and line $\ell'_2$ through $I'_2$ parallel to $\overline{A'C'}$.  The image of $P$ under the affine transformation mapping $\triangle ABC$ onto $\triangle A'B'C'$ is the intersection of lines $\ell'_1$ and $\ell'_2$.inversion Given a point $P$ and a circle centered at $O$, construct ray $\overrightarrow{OP}$, let $X$ be the point of intersection of $\overrightarrow{OP}$ with the circle.  The image of $P$ under an inversion through the circle is the image of $X$ under a dilation by $\frac{OX}{OP}$ centered at $O$.	4
635	623	One can cut a cube into 3 pyramids with square bases -- so for such pyramids the volume is indeed 1/3 hS. And then one uses Cavalieri's principle to prove that the volume of any cone is 1/3 hS.	14
636	How many knight's tours are there?	The knight's tour is a sequence of 64 squares on a chess board, where each square is visted once, and each subsequent square can be reached from the previous by a knight's move.  Tours can be cyclic, if the last square is a knight's move away from the first, and acyclic otherwise.There are several symmetries among knight's tours.  Both acyclic and cyclic tours have eight reflectional symmetries, and cyclic tours additionally have symmetries arising from starting at any square in the cycle, and from running the sequence backwards.Is it known how many knight's tours there are, up to all the symmetries?	18
639	Logic problem: Identifying poisoned wines out of a sample, minimizing test subjects with constraints	I just got out from my Math and Logic class with my friend.  During the lecture, a well-known math/logic puzzle was presented:  The King has $1000$ wines, $1$ of which is poisoned.  He needs to identify the poisoned wine as soon as possible, and with the least resources, so he hires the protagonist, a Mathematician.  The king offers you his expendable servants to help you test which wine is poisoned.  The poisoned wine is very potent, so much that one molecule of the wine will cause anyone who drinks it to die.  However, it is slow-acting.  The nature of the slow-acting poison means that there is only time to test one "drink" per servant. (A drink may be a mixture of any number of wines)  (Assume that the King needs to know within an hour, and that any poison in the drink takes an hour to show any symptoms)  What is the minimum amount of servants you would need to identify the poisoned wine?With enough time and reasoning, one can eventually see that this requires at most ten ($10$) servants (in fact, you could test 24 more wines on top of that 1000 before requiring an eleventh servant).  The proof/procedure is left to the reader.My friend and I, however, was not content with resting upon this answer.  My friend added the question:  What would be different if there were $2$ wines that were poisoned out of the 1000?  What is the new minimum then?We eventually generalized the problem to this:  Given $N$ bottles of wine ($N \gt 1$) and, of those, $k$ poisoned wines  ($0 \lt k \lt N$), what is the optimum method to identify the all of the poisoned wines, and how many servants are required ($s(N,k)$)?After some mathsing, my friend and I managed to find some (possibly unhelpful) lower and upper bounds:$ log_2 {N \choose k} \le s(N,k) \le N-1 $This is because $log_2 {N \choose k}$ is the minimum number of servants to uniquely identify the $N \choose k$ possible configurations of $k$ poisoned wines in $N$ total wines.Can anyone help us find an optimum strategy?  Besides the trivial one requiring $N-1$ servants.  How about a possible approach to start?Would this problem be any different if you were only required to find a strategy that would for sure find a wine that is not poisoned, instead of identifying all poisoned wines? (other than the slightly trivial solution of $k$ servants)	67
640	Why are differentiable complex functions infinitely differentiable?	When I studied complex analysis, I could never understand how once-differentiable complex functions could be possibly be infinitely differentiable. After all, this doesn't hold for functions from $\mathbb R ^2$ to $\mathbb R ^2$. Can anyone explain what is different about complex numbers?	62
641	640	The proofs I have seen derive this as a corollary of Cauchy's integral formula.  Look at the difference quotient as an integral, play around with it, and you get that it converges to what you'd get if you differentiated under the integral sign.Note that since harmonic functions also satisfy a similar integral equation, they are also infinitely differentiable in the same way (this also follows since they are real and imaginary parts of holomorphic functions).	6
642	622	Particles correspond to specific vectors in a representation, not to G-orbits!  The reason has to do with "symmetry breaking."  The 8 particles in the meson octet correspond to a basis of a certain 8-dimensional representation of the group SU(3) called the "adjoint representation."  At high enough energies these particles would be indistinguishable.  But at low energies the "SU(3) symmetry has been broken" and the particles become distinguishable.Another good physics example that's easier to understand is that the orbital states of electrons in atoms correspond to representations of the group SO(3) of symmetries of space (well, really SU(2) if you want to incorporate spin).  Try reading a standard quantum mechanics textbook for a little bit of this picture and then try thinking about it in terms of representation theory.	16
644	623	alt text http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/wuerfel16.gifA visual demonstration for the case of a pyramid with a square base. As Grigory states, Cavalieri's principle can be used to get the formula for the volume of a cone. We just need the base of the square pyramid to have side length $ r\sqrt\pi$. Such a pyramid has volume $\frac13 \cdot h \cdot \pi \cdot r^2. $alt text http://www.csrjjsmp.com/images/offsite/cone.pngThen the area of the base is clearly the same. The cross-sectional area at distance a from the peak is a simple matter of similar triangles: The radius of the cone's cross section will be $a/h \times r$. The side length of the square pyramid's cross section will be $\frac ah \cdot   r\sqrt\pi.$Once again, we see that the areas must be equal. So by Cavalieri's principle, the cone and square pyramid must have the same volume:$ \frac13\cdot h \cdot \pi \cdot r^2$	62
645	How is prisoner's dilemma different from chicken?	Chicken is a famous game where two people drive on a collision course straight towards each other. Whoever swerves is considered a 'chicken' and loses, but if nobody swerves, they will both crash. So the payoff matrix looks something like this:                  B swerves               B straightA swerves            tie               A loses, B winsA straight     B loses, A wins            both lose But I have heard of another situation called the prisoner's dilemma, where two prisoners are each given the choice to testify against the other, or remain silent. The payoff matrix for prisoner's dilemma also looks like                    B silent               B testifyA silent            tie               A loses, B winsA testify     B loses, A wins            both lose I remember hearing that in the prisoner's dilemma, it was always best for both prisoners to testify. But that makes no sense if you try to apply it to chicken: both drivers would crash every time, and in real life, almost always someone ends up swerving. What's the difference between the two situations?	29
646	645	The games aren't just about winning or losing, but also about utility. Here is a more accurate table for chicken:                  B swerves                B straightA swerves    No gain for either          A loses, B winsA straight     B loses, A wins         Both have large lossHere is one for prisoners dilemma:                    B silent                        B testifyA silent       Both have small loss         A large loss, B loses nothingA testify  B loses nothing, A large loss,        both medium lose In the prisoners dilemma, an individual prisoner will always do better by testifying (look at the table), however, by both testifying they end up in a worse position than if both were silent. In contrast, in chicken, going straight will be better if the other swerves and swerving will be better if the other goes straight.

647	645	(See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_%28game%29#Prisoner.27s_dilemma.)The difference is in the payoff. In the "chicken" game, the payoff matrix is like        Sw       St   Sw  0,  0   -1, +1   St +1, -1  -10, -10While in the PD game:         Si       Te   Si  3, 3     0, 5   Te  5, 0     1, 1Both games have this structure in the payoff table:         C       D   C   R, R     S, T   D   T, S     P, PBut:In PD game, the order is T > R > P > SIn Chicken game, the order is T > R > S > PThis leads a different Nash equilibria. In the PD game, if A remains silent, B chooses to testify because T > R, while if A testifies, B should also testify because P > S. So testifying is B's most rational choice after considering all possibilities.But in the Chicken game, as S > P, if A goes straight, B should swerve. This leads to two Nash equilibria in the pure game: (St, Sw) and (Sw, St). 	22
648	434	The answer to this question depends on how the problem is defined, but the answer is no, at least without defining the problem in a misleading way.Since my first solution was completely off the mark, I have deleted it and posted this new one.Consider polynomial p. If it has an integer solution, then the solution will eventually be found by random guessing. So if it is impossible to prove the existential status, there must be no solution.Now we know from this link that there is a polynomial, q, that is unsolvable in the integers iff ZFC is consistent. It is well known that ZFC cannot prove its own consistency. So if it ZFC is consistent, then q is unsolvable, but we cannot prove this as then we could prove ZFC. So it seems like it is accurate to say that if mathematics is consistent, we have a polynomial with no integer roots, but we can't prove it. However, if we are assuming maths is consistent, we can use this to prove that the equation is unsolvable (indeed that is what we have done). So, it really isn't accurate an accurate statement at all. To further clarify, when considering mathematical truth, there are two basic ways of viewing it. The first is where we are assuming that are axioms are true, which necessarily means assuming consistency. If we show any problem is equivalent to consistency, then we consider it to be true.The other is where we are considering a formal set of statements, of which the axioms have been defined to be true and seeing which statements can be derived to be true. From this viewpoint, we don't actually know whether the axioms are consistent or not. In fact, Godel's second incompleteness theorem shows that no "non-trivial" atomic system can prove its own consistency. So showing a problem is equivalent to consistency is actually the same as showing that the problem is unprovable by the atomic system.The confusion comes from assuming ZFC is consistent to eliminate one possibility in a choice, yet not allowing this assumption to be used as an axiom in the proofs.	2
649	566	A probability problem I love.Take a shuffled deck of cards. Deal off the cards one by one until you reach any Ace. Turn over the next card, and note what it is.The question: which card has a higher probability of being turned over, the Ace of Spades or the Two of Hearts?	10

655	Proof for multiplying generating functions	I've learned that multiplying two generating functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ will give the result \begin{equation*}\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(\sum_{j=0}^k a_j\,b_{k-j}\right)x^k.\end{equation*}I've used the result, but it was presented in my class without proof and I'm having some trouble tracking one down.  Weak google-foo today, I suppose.  Can anyone give me a pointer to a proof?  If this is a question better answered in book form, that is fine as well.	5
656	How can I write an equation that matches any sequence?	One thing I have been wondering about lately is how to write an equation that describes a pattern of numbers. What I mean is:x   0    1    2 y   1    5    9If I have this, I can tell that an equation that describes this would be y=4x+1. In fact, I don't even need the 3rd pair of numbers. It's very easy when the equation is a straight line. But when the equation is a parabola, its not always that easy. For example:   x   0    1    2 y   1    2    5  I can tell this is $ y=x^2+1$, because I recognize the pattern. But I can't always tell just by looking at the numbers what the right equation should be. Is there some way to always know the right equation? I know that if you get the $x=0$ term you can get the c in $y=ax^2+bx+c$, but that's not enough to let me solve it like I can when the equation is just a line.  For example, can someone show me how you would do it for  x    0     1     2y    5     4     7It's not a homework question, I promise!	11
657	656	If you know your relationship is going to be a polynomial, then there are some pretty (conceptually) simple ways you can do this.If you know what degree your polynomial is (line, parabola, cubic, etc.) then your job will be much easier.  But if not, then you simply need to look at the number of points you have.If you are given one point, the best you can do is of degree 0  ( y = k )If you are given two points, the best you can do is of degree 1 ( y = A x + B )If you are given three points, the best you can do is of degree 2 ( y = A x2 + B x + C )If you are given four points, the best you can do is of degree 3 ( y = A x3 + B x2 + C x + D )etc.When I say "the best you can do", what I mean is -- if you have a parabola, but are only given two points, then you really can't identify the parabola.  But you can say that it's a simple line.Let's assume you have three points.  The "best you can do" is assume that it is degree 2.  If it is actually of degree one, your answer will magically turn into a line ( your x^2 coefficient will be 0 )The basic idea of solving relationships/equations is:  If you have n unknowns, you need n equations/points.Notice how, in the form of the Parabola ( y = A x2 + B x + C ), you have three unknowns?  And also three equations! (points)Let's pick three arbitrary pointsx   1    2    4y   6    7    3You would set up three equations:6 = 12 * A + 1 * B + C7 = 22 * A + 2 * B + C3 = 42 * A + 4 * B + CThree equations, three unknowns.  You should be able to solve this with a combination of most system-of-equation-solving rules.In our case, we find:A = -1B = 4C = 3So our equation is y = -x2 + 4 x + 3Note that, if your original three points formed a line, your $A$ would $= 0$However, if your equation is NOT a polynomial, then you are left with little more than guess and check, plugging in various coefficients and trials (exponential?  trigonometric?)The beauty of the polynomial approach is that a polynomial of high enough degree will always fit any list of points. (provided that the points form a function)	11
658	655	It is actually the other way round. A generating function is generally defined to have an addition operation where the components are added and a multiplication operation like that you mentioned. Once we have made these definitions, we observe that polynomials obey the same laws and so that it is convenient to represent generating functions as infinite polynomials rather than just an infinite tuple.	2
659	Is this the right categorical generalisation of dual space	MotivatationI am presently looking at a structure that I am trying to pin down- my strategy being to pull the thing up into the greatest possible generality (based on the bits I'm sure about) and narrow it down from there. The situation I have is somewhat similar to the dual space structure in vector spaces, though almost certainly less well-behaved and vector spaces alone will not cut it.The ConstructionConsider a vector space $V$ over a field $k$- its dual space $V^*$ appears naturally as the set linear of maps   $$w^* : V \to k$$which, coincidentally, form a vector space in themselves. We can generalise this to arbitrary categories $A$, $B$, $C$ by setting $B=hom(A,C)$. Then, at least in some sense, $B=A^*$. So far so standard, but I want more: a nice property of dual spaces is that an element of $V \otimes V^*$ can be canonically seen as an element of $hom(V,V)$- this is because of the way that $k$ acts on $V$ by multiplication. We can mimic this by letting $C$ be a monoid acting on $A$.  In summary: A category $A$ acted on by a monoid $C$ and a dual A $A^*:=hom(A,C)$I am particularly interested in when $A$ is also a monoid, especially so when $A$ is a space of stochastic matrices.Questions:So this isn't too unlikely a construction, in fact it's probably forehead-slappingly well known, so:What is it called, if anything?In what cases can we have $A=B=C$? Is that necessarily a permutation group for example?Are there any useful canonical examples, besides vector spaces?Better yet, theorems??? Papers???As you can probably tell, I am no category theorist, so any help would be awesome.	5
660	655	Casebash is correct that this is a definition and not a theorem. But the motivation from 3.48 (Defintion of product of series) of little Rudin may convince you that this is a good definition:$\sum_{n=0}^{\inf} a_n z^n \cdot \sum_{n=0}^{\inf} b_n z^n = (a_0+a_1z+a_2z^2+ \cdots)(b_0+b_1z+b_2z^2+ \cdots)$$=a_0b_0+(a_0b_1 + a_1b_0)z + (a_0b_2+a_1b_1+a_2b_0)z^2 + \cdots$$=c_0+c_1z+c_2z^2+ \cdots $where $c_n=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}$  	5
661	656	Given a list of terms of a sequence as you describe, one technique that may be of use (supplementary to Justin's answer) is finite differences.  Calculate the differences between successive terms.  If these first differences are constant, then a linear equation fits the terms you have.  If not, compute the differences of the differences.  If these second differences are constant, then a quadratic equation fits the terms you have.  If not, you can continue to compute differences until you reach a constant difference (in the nth differences means an nth degree polynomial), differences that are a constant multiple of the previous differences (exponential of some sort), or you run out of terms.  In any case, what you find is limited to matching the terms you know, as without some kind of general rule for the sequence, the first unknown term could be anything and completely alter the pattern (and with n known terms, a polynomial of degree n-1 will always perfectly fit).	3
662	656	In the general case of trying to predict some infinite sequence of integers, there is no formula. This is because there is no reason to expect a pattern to continue, since all sequences are possible. However, you can say a certain number is more likely given a set of functions. For instance if you considered all Turing machines, you could say that given n elements of a sequence look at all the Turing machines that predict the current sequence, and then find the most predicted next number. There still isn't a efficient way to compute what the most likely next number is. Ray Solomonoff called this "Universal Probabilistic Induction" This is explained in more depth here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_inference	2
663	659	I believe the right generalization of dual spaces is that of a dual object in a tensor category, which I will assume symmetric for convenience.Recall what makes a dual space of a vector space work: We have a map $V \times V^* \to k$ (for $k$ the ground field). The problem is, this isn't a homomorphism in the category of vector spaces; it is rather a bilinear map. So you can think of it as a map $V \otimes V^* \to k$ instead.  This is why you need a tensor structure to think of duals.This isn't enough, though, because we need to know that the pairing is nondegenerate.  One way to express this is that there's a map $k \to V \times V^*$ mapping 1 to the "Casimir element" (which is the sum $\sum e_i \otimes e_i^{\vee}$ where $e_i$ ranges over a basis of $V$ and $e_i^{\vee}$ the dual basis; it is independent of the choice of $e_i$ as a quick computation shows).  The Casimir morphism satisfies the condition that $V \to (k) \otimes V \to (V \otimes V^*) \otimes V \to V \otimes (V^* \otimes V)$ is just the identity.Conversely, this is enough to show that the pairing is nondegenerate.  So, anyway, how does this make sense in a symmetric tensor category?  Basically, $V$ is the object, $V^*$ the putative dual, and $k$ replaced by the unital object. This definition is entirely arrow-theoretic, and it all goes through as usual.It is an exercise to check that the dual is unique.Some examples:This coincides with the usual dual in the category of vector spacesThis coincides with the dual sheaf if one is working in the category of locally free sheaves on a schemeThis corresponds to the dual (contragredient) representation in the (tensor) category of representations of any Hopf algebra (so this includes representations of finite groups and Lie algebras)Oh, and what happens if you don't have a symmetric tensor category? Then you have to worry about "left" and "right" duals, respectively.  For more about all this, I recommend the notes of Pavel Etingof on tensor categories.	4
664	Finding Moment of Inertia (Rotational Inertia?) $I$ Using Integration?	I just came back from my Introduction to Rotational Kinematics class, and one of the important concepts they described was Rotational Inertia, or Moment of Inertia.It's basically the equivalent of mass in Netwon's $F = m a$ in linear motion.  The equivalent rotational equation is $\tau = I \alpha$, where $\tau$ is rotational force, $\alpha$ is rotational acceleration, and $I$ is rotational inertia.For a point about an axis, $I$ is $m r^2$, where $r$ is the distance from the point to the axis of rotation.For a continuous body, this is an integral -- $I = \int r^2 \,dm$.This really doesn't make any sense to me...you have two independent variables?  I am only used to having one independent variable and one constant.  So I would solve this, using my experience with calculus (which encompasses a read through the Sparks Notes packet) as $ I = m r^2 $But obviously, this is wrong?  $r$ is not a constant!  How do I deal with it?  Do I need to replace $r$ with an expression that varies with $m$?  But how could $r$ possibly vary with $m$?  Isn't it more likely the other way around?  But how can $m$ vary with $r$?  It's all rather confusing me.Could someone help me figure out what to do with all these substitutions for, example, figuring out the Moment of Inertia of a hoop with no thickness and width $w$, with the axis of rotation running through its center orthogonal to its plane?	10
665	664	Seeing an expression like $I = \int r^2 dm$ is certainly confusing the first time you see it. When you see an expression like $I = \int x^2 dx$ we effectively iterating over a range on the x axis and adding up the area of an infinite amount of infinitesimally small strips. Note that the area of each strip is approximated as the function value (x^2) times the strip length (dx). When you see an expression like dm, we are iterating over masses instead. We still sum up the function value (r^2), but this time we multiply it by the strip mass (dm). To solve the problem, we usually put m in terms of another variable which we can iterate over more easily.For example, consider the moment of inertia of a rod of length L around its center with total mass of L. Each bit of length (dx) has mass (dm) and r=|x|. Solving for $I = \int r^2 dm = \int |x|^2 dx = \int x^2 dx = (x^3)/3+c$. Now, we have definite values for x to sub in (-L/2 and L/2), so we write I=(L/8)/3-(-L/8)/3=L/12Now lets calculate the moment of inertia of the hoop case you described. We break the hoop up into infinitesimally small rings the same distance from the center. Let the hoop have inner thickness r and outer thickness R. The area is R^2-r^2. The area density, d, is therefore m/(R^2-r^2). A ring at radius k with thickness dk has area 2pi k dk, mass is 2pi k dk * m/(R^2-r^2) and moment of inertia around the central axis 2pi k^3 dk * m/(R^2-r^2). The integral is pi/2*k^4 *m/(R^2-r^2)+c. Subbing in the exact values, we get, pi/2*(R^4-r^4) *m/(R^2-r^2)=pi/2*(R^2+r^2)*m	5
667	Stacks are just sheaves up to Isomorphism	I have heard that one can think of stacks on a site as taking sheaves but instead of the restrictions being equal, we just loosen it to isomorphic, and treat the sheaf conditions with the "obvious" coherence relations.How seriously can one take this analogy? Note that my background is stacks is feeble at best.I hope this question isn't too vague. One may choose to respond to this question with "That analogy is stupid because of __ gotcha". Thanks in advance!	16
668	What's an intuitive way to think about the determinant?	In my linear algebra class, we just talked about determinants. So far I’ve been understanding the material okay, but now I’m very confused. I get that when the determinant is zero, the matrix doesn’t have an inverse. I can find the determinant of a $2\times 2$ matrix by the formula. Our teacher showed us how to compute the determinant of an $N \times N$ matrix by breaking it up into the determinants of smaller matrices, and apparently there is a way by summing over a bunch of permutations. But the notation is really hard for me and I don’t really know what’s going on with them anymore. Can someone help me figure out what a determinant is, intuitively, and how all those definitions of it are related?	449
669	668	Your trouble with determinants is pretty common. They’re a hard thing to teach well, too, for two main reasons that I can see: the formulas you learn for computing them are messy and complicated, and there’s no “natural” way to interpret the value of the determinant, the way it’s easy to interpret the derivatives you do in calculus at first as the slope of the tangent line. It’s hard to believe things like the invertibility condition you’ve stated when it’s not even clear what the numbers mean and where they come from.Rather than show that the many usual definitions are all the same by comparing them to each other, I’m going to state some general properties of the determinant that I claim are enough to specify uniquely what number you should get when you put in a given matrix. Then it’s not too bad to check that all of the definitions for determinant that you’ve seen satisfy those properties I’ll state.The first thing to think about if you want an “abstract” definition of the determinant to unify all those others is that it’s not an array of numbers with bars on the side. What we’re really looking for is a function that takes N vectors (the N columns of the matrix) and returns a number. Let’s assume we’re working with real numbers for now.Remember how those operations you mentioned change the value of the determinant? Switching two rows or columns changes the sign. Multiplying one row by a constant multiplies the whole determinant by that constant. The general fact that number two draws from: the determinant is linear in each row. That is, if you think of it as a function $\det: \mathbb{R}^{n^2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, then $$ \det(a \vec v_1 +b \vec w_1 , \vec v_2 ,\ldots,\vec v_n ) = a \det(\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n) + b \det(\vec w_1, \vec v_2, \ldots,\vec v_n),$$ and the corresponding condition in each other slot.The determinant of the identity matrix $I$ is $1$.I claim that these facts are enough to define a unique function that takes in N vectors (each of length N) and returns a real number, the determinant of the matrix given by those vectors. I won’t prove that, but I’ll show you how it helps with some other interpretations of the determinant.In particular, there’s a nice geometric way to think of a determinant. Consider the unit cube in N dimensional space: the set of vectors of length N with coordinates 0 or 1 in each spot. The determinant of the linear transformation (matrix) T is the signed volume of the region gotten by applying T to the unit cube. (Don’t worry too much if you don’t know what the “signed” part means, for now).How does that follow from our abstract definition?Well, if you apply the identity to the unit cube, you get back the unit cube. And the volume of the unit cube is 1.If you stretch the cube by a constant factor in one direction only, the new volume is that constant. And if you stack two blocks together aligned on the same direction, their combined volume is the sum of their volumes: this all shows that the signed volume we have is linear in each coordinate when considered as a function of the input vectors.Finally, when you switch two of the vectors that define the unit cube, you flip the orientation. (Again, this is something to come back to later if you don’t know what that means).So there are ways to think about the determinant that aren’t symbol-pushing. If you’ve studied multivariable calculus, you could think about, with this geometric definition of determinant, why determinants (the Jacobian) pop up when we change coordinates doing integration. Hint: a derivative is a linear approximations of the associated function, and consider a “differential volume element” in your starting coordinate system.It’s not too much work to check that the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ is $\Big|{}^{a\;b}_{c\;d}\Big|$either: you might try that to get a sense for things.	266
670	432	These implications are reached by considering the three, different cases for the roots $\{ r_1, r_2, r_3 \}$ of the polynomial: repeated root, all distinct real roots, or two complex roots and one real root.When one of the roots is repeated, say $r_1$ and $r_2$, then it is clear that the discriminant is $0$ because the $r_1 - r_2$ term of the product is $0$.When one root is a complex number $\rho = x+ yi$, then by the complex conjugate root theorem, $\overline{\rho} = x - yi$ is also a root. By the same theorem, the remaining third root must be real. Evaluating the product in the discriminant for this case,$$\begin{align*}(\rho - \overline{\rho})^2 (\rho - r_3)^2 (\overline{\rho} - r_3)^2 &= (2yi)^2 (x + yi - r^3)^2  (x - yi - r^3)^2 \\ &= -4y^2 [((x - r_3) + yi) ((x - r_3) - yi) ]^2 \\ &= -4y^2 ((x - r_3)^2 + y^2)^2 \end{align*}$$which is less than or equal to $0$.Finally, when all roots are real, the product is clearly positive.Putting it all together, $\Delta$:less than $0$ implies that one root is complex;equal to $0$ implies that one root is repeated;greater than $0$ implies that all roots are distinct and real.	5
671	When you randomly shuffle a deck of cards, what is the probability that it is a unique permutation never before configured?	I just came back from a class on Probability in Game Theory, and was musing over something in my head.Assuming, for the sake of the question:Playing cards in their current state have been around for approximately eight centuriesA deck of playing cards is shuffled to a random configuration one billion times per dayEvery shuffle ever is completely (theoretically) random and unaffected by biases caused by human shuffling and the games the cards are used forBy "deck of cards", I refer to a stack of unordered $52$ unique cards, with a composition that is identical from deck to deck.This would, approximately, be on the order of $3 \cdot 10^{14}$ random shuffles in the history of playing cards.If I were to shuffle a new deck today, completely randomly, what are the probabilistic odds (out of $1$) that you create a new unique permutation of the playing cards that has never before been achieved in the history of $3 \cdot 10^{14}$ similarly random shuffles?My first thought was to think that it was a simple matter of $\frac{1}{52!} \cdot 3 \cdot 10^{14}$, but then I ran into things like Birthday Paradox.  While it is not analogous (I would have to be asking about the odds that any two shuffled decks in the history of shuffled decks ever matched), it has caused me to question my intuitive notions of Probability.What is wrong in my initial approach, if it is wrong?What is the true probability?And, if the probability is less than $0.5$, if we how many more years (centuries?) must we wait, assuming the current rate of one billion shuffles per day, until we reach a state where the probability is $0.5$+?   $0.9$+?(Out of curiosity, it would be neat to know the analogous birthday paradox answer, as well)	21
672	671	Your original answer of $\dfrac{3 \times 10^{14}}{52!}$ is not far from being right. That is in fact the expected number of times any ordering of the cards has occurred.The probability that any particular ordering of the cards has not occurred, given your initial assumptions, is $\left(1-\frac1{52!}\right)^{(3\times10^{14})}$, and the probability that it has occurred is 1 minus this value.  But for small values of $n\epsilon$, $(1+\epsilon)^n$ is nearly $1+n\epsilon$.  In particular, since $52!\approx 8\times 10^{67}$ and so $\dfrac{3\times10^{14}}{52!}\approx 3.75\times 10^{-54}$ is microscopically small, $1-\left(1-\frac1{52!}\right)^{(3\times10^{14})}$ is very nearly $\frac1{52!}\times (3\times10^{14})$.  	15
673	671	Suppose we shuffle a deck and get a permutation p. For each previous shuffling there is a 1-1/52! chance that p doesn't match it. Each previous shuffling is independent, in that regardless of what p and the other permutations are, the chance of p matching the shuffling is 1-1/52! When probabilities are independent we can simply multiple them to find the chance of all the events happening. In this case, the each event is actually a match not happening, so the chance of no matches given n previous shuffles is (1-1/52!)^n. We can then complete the calculations as Michael did.	2
674	How do Lagrange multipliers work to find the lowest value of a function subject to a constraint?	I have been using Lagrange multipliers in constrained optimization problems, but I don't see how they actually work to simultaneously satisfy the constraint and find the lowest possible value of an objective function.	36
675	674	This type of problem is generally referred to as constrained optimization.  A general technique to solve many of these types of problems is known as the method of Lagrange multipliers, here is an example of such a problem using Lagrange multipliers and a short justification as to why the technique works.Consider the parabaloid given by $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$.  The global minimum of this surface lies at the origin (at $x=0$, $y=0$).  If we are given the constraint, a requirement on the relationship between $x$ and $y$, that $3x+y=6$, then the origin can no longer be our solution (since $3\cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 \neq 6$).  Yet, there is a lowest point on this function satisfying the given constraint. What we have so far:Objective function: $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$, subject to: $3x+y=6$.From here we can derive the Lagrange formulation of our constrained minimization problem.  This will be a function $L$ of $x$, $y$, and a single Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ (since we have only a single constraint). It will be this new function that we minimize.$L(x,y,\lambda) = x^2 + y^2 + \lambda(3x+y-6)$The Lagrange formulation incorporates our original function along with our constraint(s).  On the way toward minimizing $L$, we will have to minimize the objective function $x^2 + y^2$, as well as minimize the contribution from the constraint, which is now weighted by a factor of $\lambda$.  If the constraint is met, then the expression $3x+y-6$ will necessarily be zero, and will not contribute anything the value of $L$. This is the trick of the technique.Minimizing the Lagrange formulation:To minimize $L$ we simply find the $x,y$, and $\lambda$ values that make its gradient zero.  (This is exactly analogous to setting the first derivative to zero in calculus.)  $\nabla L = 0:$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 2x + 3 \lambda = 0$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 2y + \lambda = 0$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 3x + y - 6 = 0$,In our example we have arrived at a system of simultaneous linear equations which can (and should) be solved with matrix algebra.  The solution will be a vector holding values for $x, y$ and $\lambda$.  The lowest value of the objective function, subject to the given constraint, sits at $(x,y,f(x,y))$, and the Lagrange multiplier does not have an immediate physical interpretation.

676	Probability that a stick randomly broken in two places can form a triangle	Randomly break a stick (or a piece of dry spaghetti, etc.) in two places, forming three pieces.  The probability that these three pieces can form a triangle is $\frac14$ (coordinatize the stick form $0$ to $1$, call the breaking points $x$ and $y$, consider the unit square of the coordinate plane, shade the areas that satisfy the triangle inequality edit: see comments on the question, below, for a better explanation of this).The other day in class*, my professor was demonstrating how to do a Monte Carlo simulation of this problem on a calculator and wrote a program that, for each trial did the following:Pick a random number $x$ between $0$ and $1$.  This is the first side length.Pick a random number $y$ between $0$ and $1 - x$ (the remaning part of the stick).  This is the second side length.The third side length is $1 - x - y$.Test if the three side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality (in all three permutations).He ran around $1000$ trials and was getting $0.19$, which he said was probably just random-chance error off $0.25$, but every time the program was run, no matter who's calculator we used, the result was around $0.19$.What's wrong with the simulation method?  What is the theoretical answer to the problem actually being simulated?(* the other day was more than $10$ years ago)	26
677	Proving that this Game on Polygons Ends	About two years ago, I started thinking about the following problem: You're given an $N$ and an $S$, positive integers. You start with an $N$-gon that has positive integer labels at each vertex, such that the labels sum to $S$. A "move" is replacing the label at some vertex with the positive difference of the labels at its two adjacent vertices. You win if you can exhibit a sequence of moves such that all of the vertex labels are zero at the end.This is a generalization of 2003 USAMO problem B3, "A positive integer is written at each vertex of a hexagon. A move is to replace a number by the (non-negative) difference between the two numbers at the adjacent vertices. If the starting numbers sum to $2003^{2003}$, show that it is always possible to make a sequence of moves ending with zeros at every vertex." The USAMO problem itself can be answered in the affirmative by doing a modified greedy algorithm for most of the moves, showing there's always a move where you can reduce the problem to a smaller sum while changing the parities systematically, then doing casework for the "end game" to show that each configuration of 1's and 0's (or k's and zeros, the cases are of course equivalent) can be gotten down to all zeros.It's easy to check that for $n=4$ and $S$ odd, there's a winning strategy. I have lots of simulation/numerical evidence and some half baked ideas to suggest that, in general, there's a winning strategy if and only if $N$ and $S$ have opposite parities. But in two years of coming back to it on and off, I haven't really made progress. It's open, as far as I know, though I knew that more surely two years ago than I do now.Ideas?	13
679	676	The three triangle inequalities are\begin{align}x + y &> 1-x-y \\x + (1-x-y) &> y \\y + (1-x-y) &> x \\\end{align}Your problem is that in picking the smaller number first from a uniform distribution, it's going to end up being bigger than it would if you had just picked two random numbers and taken the smaller one. (You'll end up with an average value of $1/2$ for the smaller instead of $1/3$ like you actually want.) Now when you pick $y$ on $[0, 1-x]$, you're making it smaller than it should be (ending up with average value of $1/4$). To understand this unequal distribution, we can substitute $y (1-x)$ for $y$ in the original inequalities and we'll see the proper distribution.(Note that the $y$-axis of the graph doesn't really go from $0$ to $1$; instead the top represents the line $y=1-x$. I'm showing it as a square because that's how the probabilities you were calculating were being generated.) Now the probability you're measuring is the area of the strangely-shaped region on the left, which is$$ \int_0^{1/2} \frac{1}{2-2x} - \frac{2x-1}{2x-2} \,dx = \ln(2) - 1/2 \approx 0.19314 . $$I believe that's the answer you calculated.	25
680	Probability that two people see each other at the coffee shop	Two mathematicians each come into a coffee shop at a random time between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. each day. Each orders a cup of coffee then sits at a table, reading a newspaper for 20 minutes before leaving to go to work.On any day, what is the probability that both mathematicians are at the coffee shop at the same time (that is, their arrival times are within 20 minutes of each other)?	8
681	680	Working in hours and letting 8:00 a.m. be t=0, each mathematician's arrival time is a number between 0 and 1.  The sample space can be represented by the unit square in the coordinate plane with one professor's arrival time as x and the other's as y, where regions with equal areas are equally likely.  We want x - 1/3 < y < x + 1/3 -- that is, the second professor arrives earlier than the first by no more than 1/3 of an hour or later than the first by no more than 1/3 of an hour.The area of the desired region is 5/9.	18
682	593	The answer is, it's just a fact “cone over a simplex is a simplex” rewritten in terms of the generating function:observe that because n-simplex is a cone over (n-1)-simplex $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}vol(\text{n-simplex w. edge x}) = vol(\text{(n-1)-simplex w. edge x})$; in other words $e(x):=\sum_n vol\text{(n-simplex w. edge x)}$ satisfies an equvation $e'(x)=e(x)$. So $e(x)=Ce^x$ -- and C=1 because e(0)=1.	4
683	How can I randomly generate trees?	I want to randomly generate trees, i.e. undirected acyclic graphs with a single root, making sure that all possible trees with  a fixed number of nodes n are equally likely.	10
684	683	Knuth says to look at it as generating all nested parentheses in lexicographic order.Look here for the detailshttp://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/fasc4a.ps. 	4
685	618	Basic TheoryThe way to solve this problem is to calculate how much each payment reduces your debt after you have been repaying your loan for $n$ years. Let $r=1+R/100$, ie. this converts the interest rate from a percentage to a value you can multiply your debt by to calculate how much you owe after adding one time period's interest.If I make a payment of $P$ at the end of the $k$th year, then we avoid paying interest on this money $n-k$ times and so we reduce our debt by $Pr^{n-k}$. We sum up the future values of all our payments:$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n Pr^{n-k}$If we reverse this, it is equivalent to:$\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} Pr^k$This is a geometric series, which can be solved using the formula $\frac{ar^{n-1}}{r-1}$ where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the factor and $n$ is the number of terms being summed. We then attempt to equate this with the debt owed after $n$ years, which is $Mr^n$.We now compare the two equations:$\frac{Pr^{n-1}}{r-1} = Mr^n$Calculating $n$We group the $r^n$ terms:$\frac{P}{r-1} = r^n\frac{M-P}{r-1}$$r^n = \frac{P}{M(r-1)-P}$So we just take the $n$th log of the right hand side.Calculating repaymentsGiven the principal ($M$) and the interest rate ($r$), what will my payment-per-term ($P$) be over $n$ accruation terms?$P=\frac{Mr^n(r-1)}{r^{n-1}}$Payments made at the start of the yearIn this case, the future values of our interest payment simply become:$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n Pr^k$We proceed as we did before.NotesWe could also solve this problem using present value instead of future value.	3
686	Combinations of selecting $n$ objects with $k$ different types	Suppose that I am buying cakes for a party. There are $k$ different types and I intend to buy a total of $n$ cakes. How many different combinations of cakes could I possibly bring to the party?	14
687	Increasing network throughput by cutting routes	Suppose we model traffic flow between two points with a directed graph. Each route has either a constant travel time or one that linearly increases with traffic. We assume that each driver wishes to minimise their own travel time and we assume that the drivers form a Nash equilibria. Can removing a route ever decrease the average travelling time?Note that the existence of multiple Nash equilibria makes this question a bit complicated. To clarify, I am looking for a route removal that will guarantee a decrease in the average traveling time regardless of the Nash equilibria that are chosen before and after.	9
690	686	Let g(n,k) = # combinations of cakes.Notice that:g(n,1) = 1. (all the cakes are the same)g(n,2) = n+1. (e.g. for 5 cakes, the # of cakes of type 1 can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)g(1,k) = k.g(2,k) = k*(k-1)/2 + k (the first term is two different cakes; the second term is when both cakes are the same), as long as k > 1. (otherwise g(2,1) = 1)g(3,k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2)/6 + k*(k-1)/2 * 2 + k (the first term is 3 different cakes; the second term is 2 different cakes, with a *2 since there are two choices for which one to duplicate, the third term is when all 3 cakes are the same), as long as k > 2.If we think of k as a radix rather than the # of cakes, then this problem is equivalent to expressing the # of distinct n-digit numbers in base k whose digits are in sorted order. (e.g. 1122399 is equivalent to 9921231)I think I can express it as a nonrecursive sum:g(n,k) = sum from j=1 to max(n,k) of { (k choose j) * h(n,j) } where h(n,j) is the # of ways to partition N cakes using j different types. (the term in the sum is when there are j distinct cakes actually chosen.)But that's about as far as I can get... :/edit: looks like it's combinations with repetitions = ((k+n-1) choose n). (same as the wikipedia article with n and k swapped)	2
691	686	Using a method that's often called "stars and bars":We draw $n$ stars in a row to represent the cakes, and $k-1$ bars to divide them up. All of the stars to the left of the first bar are cakes of the first type; stars between the first two bars are of the second type; . . . .**|***||*|Here's an example with $n=6$ and $k=5$. We're getting 2 of the first type, 3 of the second type, 0 of the third type, 1 of the fourth type, and 0 of the fifth type.In order to solve the problem, we just need to reorder the stars and bars by choosing the $k-1$ spots for the bars out of the $n+k-1$ total spots, so our answer is:$$ \binom{n+k-1}{k-1}. $$	22
692	154	Complex numbers are the final step in a sequence of increasingly "unreal" extensions to the number system that humans have found it necessary to add over the centuries in order to express significant numerical concepts.The first such "unreal number" was zero, back in the mists of time. It seems obvious to us now, but it must have seemed strange at first. How can the number of sheep I have be zero, when I don't actually have any sheep?Negative numbers are the next most obvious addition to the family of numbers. But what does it mean to have -2 apples? If I have 3 apples and you have 5, it's convenient to be able to say that I have -2 more apples than you. Even so, during the middle ages many mathematicians were very uncomfortable with the idea of negative numbers and tried to arrange their equations so that they didn't occur.Rationals (fractions) seem real enough, since I'm happy to have 2/5 of a pizza. However, this is not the number of pizzas that I have, just a ratio between 0 and 1 pizzas, and so is further removed from the concept of counting.More significant philosophical problems problems arose when irrational numbers were first discovered by the classical Greeks. They were astonished when Euclid (or one of his predecessors) proved that the diagonal of a unit square could not be represented by ratio of two integers. This was such an outrageous idea to them that they called these numbers "irrational". However, they couldn't easily deny their existence since they have a direct geometric representation.Irrational numbers were first understood as the solutions to algebraic equations such as x^2 = 2 but this still doesn't cover all the possible numbers that we need. For example, the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference is π and so has a direct geometric representation. However, in 1882 π was proved to be transcendental, meaning that it can't be defined as the solution to a specific algebraic equation. This begins to seem a lot less "real", especially when you consider that there are many important transcendental numbers that, unlike π, don't have a geometric interpretation.There are of course many algebraic equations that don't have a solution even among the irrational numbers, and in some ways there's no reason why they should. However, when 16th century mathematicians like Gerolamo Cardano began working on solutions to cubic equations they found that the square roots of negative numbers began cropping up very naturally in their procedures, even though the solutions themselves were purely real. This eventually led people to explore the arithmetic of complex numbers and they were surprised to find that it produced a consistent and beautiful theory.However, complex numbers don't have such an intuitively obvious geometrical meaning as the numbers that came before. They are typically represented graphically as points in the 2D plane, and the rules of addition and multiplication are equivalent to certain operations on lengths and angles, but those operations aren't driven by geometrical necessity in quite the way that squares and circles are. Even so, complex numbers are a perfect representation for various physical phenomena such as the state of particles in quantum mechanics and the behaviour of varying currents in electrical circuits. They are also very useful for reducing the cost of computation in 3D computer graphics.The really special thing about complex numbers, though, is that they are the end of this journey that has been going on for millenia. There is no need to invent further number systems to provide solutions to problems expressed in terms of complex numbers because now every non-contradictory equation, algebraic or transcendental, has a solution within the complex numbers. They are a self-sufficient, consistent system.Physicists have been breaking matter down into smaller and smaller particles over the years. Molecules, atoms, nuclei, protons, quarks. When will the process stop? For several decades it was felt that quarks could be the final, indivisible particle. However, new theoretical frameworks such as string theory are suggesting that there may be more fundamental entities than quarks. Because physics ultimately relies on experimental verification, we can never be sure that there aren't going to be more steps in the sequence.In mathematics, however, we can prove things for all time. Complex numbers are the final step in the sequence, the numbers that we have been reaching for since before the beginning of recorded history. Every other number system is just a subset of the complex numbers, just a part of the true picture. Complex numbers are the real thing.	9
693	Picking cakes if we need at least one of each type	I need $n$ cakes for a party. I go to the cake shop and there are $k$ different kinds of cake. For variety, I'd like to get at least one of each cake. How many ways can I do this?	4
694	693	Similar to the stars and bars technique, consider the n cakes as a row of n stars *.  Instead of permuting them with k-1 bars | (which allows two bars next to each other, giving 0 of a type, place the k-1 bars (needed to split the n stars into k types) into the n-1 spaces between the stars, allowing at most one bar per space.  The number of ways to do this is ${n-1 \choose k-1}$.Alternately, since you need one of each type, there are only n-k cakes for which you are choosing types.  Using the stars and bars technique, there are ${(n-k)+k-1 \choose k-1} = {n-1 \choose k-1}$ ways to do it.	7
696	656	Of course there are infinite equation (even if you require them to be infinitely differentiable...) that satisfy the given constraints. As Isaac and Justin already wrote, you may always find a polynomial of degree at most n-1 (where n is the number of points given) which satisfies the given data; but you cannot be sure that this is the right answer. Moreover, if data is not exact but approximate the resulting polynomial may be quite different from the correct function, since it would likely hade huge peaks and falls. In such cases, an approximate method like least squares could be more useful.	2
698	Looking for a probability distribution	Recently I discussed an experiment with a friend. Assume we start a random experiment. At first there is an array with size $100,000$, all set to $0$. We calculate at each round a random number modulo $2$ and select one random position in that array. If the number in the array is $1$, nothing is changed and otherwise the pre-computed value is set. The question is: how many distinct hash values would we have added in $1$%, $5$%, $50$%, $95$%, $99$% of all cases?Example: $4$ rounds with array of size $10$:Array                     Position   random number[0,...,0]                    5              0[0,...,0]                    7              1[0,...0,1,0,0,0]             6              1[0,..0,.1,1,0,0,0]           6              0[0,..0,.1,1,0,0,0]           2              0First we considered this a somehow simple problem, but after thinking for some hours, searching the web, and asking some math students, we couldn't find a solution. Do you know a probability distribution for this problem? Remark: Was also posted on Math Overflow and got its answer there.	2
699	697	Sure, there are variations on least-squares approximations.Here's an engineering answer (not really a pure math answer): On one project I did at my company, we had a thermal model that was approximating the thermal transfer function from measured power to device temperature. The cost of error in the positive direction (underestimating temperature) was worse than the cost of the same error in the negative direction (overestimating temperature) -- so we used a weighting function that was (K * error ^ 2) where K was 1 for negative temperature error and greater than 1 (e.g. 1.5 or 2) for positive temperature error.We thought about using more complicated mappings (10 degrees underestimate much worse than 1 degree underestimate) but didn't want to go there... I assume this has some analog to a utility function (e.g. expected monetary gain of a system with random outcome has nonlinear mapping to "happiness" or "utility") where nonlinearity is intentionally introduced.You could do something similar for approximating functions with polynomials: a least-squares fit treats error in a linear way, but there may be places in the function (e.g. at the ends or at the center) where minimizing error is more or less important.	0
700	57	The calculus of relations is an algebra of operations over sets of pairs of individuals, where for any relation R, we can express the relation in the usual infix manner: x R y iff (x,y) ∈ R.  This allows all of the properties of relations to be expressed in equational form.There are four fundamental relations we want to define, each of which make non-useless examples of three of your five properties of relations, plus one other useful property, irreflexivity:Eq = {(x,x) | for each individual x}.  This is the diagonal or equality relation that holds only between something and itself.  It is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, which is to say it is an equivalence relation.All = {(x,y) | for all individuals x,y}.  The whenever relation, it is also an equivalence relation.Neq = {(x,y) | for all individuals x,y for which x ≠ y}: the inequality relation that holds between anything different.  It is symmetric and irreflexive, but not transitive.Never is the empty set.  It is symmetric and transitive, and irreflexive.Three basic binary operations on relations, and one unary relation:R∩S = {(x,y) | (x,y) ∈ R and (x,y) ∈ S};R–S = {(x,y) | (x,y) ∈ R and (x,y) ∉ S};R⋅S = {(x,z) | there is some y such that (x,y) ∈ R and (y,z) ∈ S} (composition);tr(R) = {(y,x) | (x,y) ∈ R} (transpose).Observe that Never = All–All, and Neq = All–Eq.We say R -> S when S holds whenever R holds.  This is the same as saying either that  R is a subset of S, or that R∩S=R, or that R-S=Never.  So Never -> Eq, and Eq -> All.Then we can express your five relations:R is reflexive when Eq -> R; dually we have an additional property of a relation, where R is anti-reflexive when R -> Neq;R is symmetric when R -> tr(R);R is anti-symmetric when R ∩ tr(R) -> Eq, or equivalently when R ∩ tr(R) ∩ Neq = 0.R is asymmetric when R ∩ tr(R)=Never: a relation is asymmetric when it is anti-symmetric and anti-reflexive;R is transitive when R⋅R -> R.Also, how can a relation be a- and antisymmetrical at the same time? Don't they cancel each other out?  — Look at Eq: it is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, although it is not asymmetric.  In fact, all asymmetric relations are anti-symmetric, but not vice versa: the difference is that asymmetric and anti-symmetric differ in what they assert about the diagonal: anti-symmetric doesn't care about what pairs there might be along the diagonal, whilst asymmetric insists that there are no pairs along the diagonal, which is irreflexivity.	0
702	603	Couldn't all transformation which send each point (x,y) to another point (x',y') which can be computed from the first one by performing only the four operations and extraction of square root?	1
704	$n$ out of $ m$ theorems (some imply the rest)	Is there symbolism (or even a name) for groups of statements in which any fixed-number of them imply all the rest?For example, in linear algebra, a basis is sometimes defined as a set of n-dimensional vectors which:Is linearly independentSpans the vector spaceContains exactly n elementsHowever, it is then shown that any TWO of these statements being true implies the third is true.  How would you write this symbolically? (other than $A \wedge B \Rightarrow C, A \wedge C \Rightarrow B, B \wedge C \Rightarrow A$, which does not scale well...)	4
706	705	Without the unit-length segment--that is, without something to compare the first segment to--its length is entirely arbitrary, so can't be valued, so there's no value of which to take the square root.Let the given segment (with length x) be AB and let point C be on ray AB such that BC = 1.  Construct the midpoint M of segment AC, construct the circle with center M passing through A, construct the line perpendicular to AB through B, and let D be one of the intersections of that line with the circle centered at M (call the other intersection E).  BD = sqrt(x).AC and DE are chords of the circle intersecting at B, so by the power of a point theorem, AB * BC = DB * BE, so x * 1 = x = DB * BE.  Since DE is perpendicular to AC and AC is a diameter of the circle, AC bisects DE and DB = BE, so x = DB^2 or DB = sqrt(x).edit: this is a special case of the more general geometric-mean construction.  Given two lengths AB and BC (arranged as above), the above construction produces the length BD = sqrt(AB * BC), which is the geometric mean of AB and BC.	10
707	The limiting case of a discrete probability problem	Say there are three jars, $j_1, j_2, j_3$ filled with different binary sequences of length two.  The distribution of the binary sequences in each of the jars is given by the $p_i^k(1-p_i)^{n-k}$, where $p_i = \frac{i}{m + 1}$ where $m$ is the number of jars, $i$ is the jar index, $k $is number of 1$$'s and $n$ is the length of the string.  So for three jars we have $p_1 = 0.25, p_2 = 0.5$, and $p_3 = 0.75$ for $j_1, j_2, j_3$ respectively.  Here are the sequences and their probabilities for $j_1$ with $p_1 = 0.25$:\begin{align*}P(00) = 9 / 16 \\P(10) = 3 / 16 \\  P(01) = 3 / 16 \\  P(11) = 1 / 16.\end{align*}If I tell you that I have selected a binary sequence and the first element is $1$ what is the E($p_i$)?Well, this can be calculated by looking at each of the jars and adding up the probability of candidate sequences times the value of $p_i$.Edit: I wasn't normalizing this conditionally space properly. I'm skipping a step which I'll explain, someone wants.\begin{equation*}E(p_i) = (4/24 * 1/4) + (8/24 * 1/2) + (12/24 * 3/4) = 14 / 24 = 0.58.\end{equation*}So the question is ... what is $E(p_i)$ when the numbers of jars goes to infinity (or alternatively, when $p$ can take on values between $0$ and $1$)? Also what happens when the size of the binary strings goes to infinity? Does it have an effect on the outcome? If it does, does the order we take the limits change the answer?And most importantly what is the general case for when I have $s$ 1's and $r$ $0$'s?, with a continuous $p$ from $0$ to $1$ and infinite sequences?	3
708	705	If you have a segment $AB$, place the unit length segment on the line where $AB$ lies, starting with $A$ and in the direction opposite to $B$; let $C$ be the other point of the segment. Now draw a semicircle with diameter $BC$ and the perpendicular to $A$; this line crosses the semicircle in a point $D$. Now $AD$ is the square root of $AB$. $\triangle BCD$ is a right triangle, like $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABD$; all of these are similar, so you find out that $AC/AD = AD/AB$. But $AC=1$, so $AD = \sqrt{AB}$.See the drawing below:	35
709	Derivation of the formula for the vertex of a parabola	I'm taking a course on Basic Conic Sections, and one of the ones we are discussing is of a parabola of the form$$y = a x^2 + b x + c$$My teacher gave me the formula:$$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$$as the $x$ coordinate of the vertex.I asked her why, and she told me not to tell her how to do her job.My smart friend mumbled something about it involving calculus, but I've always found him a rather odd fellow and I doubt I'd be able to understand a solution involving calculus, because I have no background in it.  If you use something you know from calculus, explain it to someone who has no background in it.  Because I sure don't.Is there a purely algebraic or geometrical yet elegant derivation for the $x$ coordinate of a parabola of the above form?	17
710	709	By the vertex I assume you mean the minimum/maximum point of the parabola. Indeed, this result can be discovered easily through a bit of calculus, but there is also a simple purely algebraic way, which I will present here.Let's consider a generic quadratic expression:$y = ax^2 + bx + c$We now complete the square on this formula.$y = a[x^2 + bx/a + c/a]$$y = a[(x + b/2a)^2 - (b/2a)^2 + c/a]$The expression $- (b/2a)^2 + c/a$ is a constant (it does not depend on x), so we can replace it with k for the matter of discussion.$y = a[(x + b/2a)^2 + k]$Now, depending on whether a is positive or negative, the parabola given by y will either have a maximum or minimum. Since a and k are fixed, this must occur when $(x + b/2a)^2$ is zero (we know it cannot be less than zero, and it can extend to infinity).Hence, we know that for $(x + b/2a)^2$ to be zero, $x = -b/2a$. This in turn implies that the function y is at a minimum or a maximum when this is true. Q.E.D.	22
711	709	Parabolas of the form you described (y = ...) are symmetric over a vertical line through their vertex.  Let's call that line x = k.  This means that if the graph crosses the x-axis (meaning that $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has real solution(s)), they must be equidistant from x = k, so (k,0) must be the midpoint of the segment with endpoints at the zeros of the quadratic or k is the average of the zeros.  From the quadratic formula, the two zeros of the quadratic are $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, so their sum is $-\frac{b}{a}$ and their average is $k=-\frac{b}{2a}$.  So, the x-coordinate of the vertex must be $-\frac{b}{2a}$.If the parabola does not cross the x-axis (no real solutions), there is another parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c'$ for some $c'$ for which the graph is a vertical translation of the graph of the original quadratic, but crosses the x-axis.  Its axis of symmetry is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$ and because it is a vertical translation of the original, the axis of symmetry of the original is also $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, so the vertices of both have x-coordinate $-\frac{b}{2a}$.	12
712	Why does area differentiate to perimeter for circles and not for squares?	I read this question the other day and it got me thinking: the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$, which differentiates to $2 \pi r$, which is just the perimeter of the circle.   Why doesn't the same thing happen for squares? If we start with the area formula for squares, $l^2$, this differentiates to $2l$ which is sort of right but only half the perimeter. I asked my calculus teacher and he couldn't tell me why. Can anyone explain???	28
714	712	If you use the formula you describe for squares, your measurements are coming from one corner of the square.  Imagine those measurements growing slowly.  The square will grow, but only along the two sides opposite the corner from which you measured, so the derivative of the area formula is only the perimeter on those two sides.Alternately, consider measuring the size of a square by the distance d from its center to the midpoint of a side.  This would make the side length 2d, the perimeter 8d and the area 4d^2.  Now, the derivative of the area is the perimeter.  (Also, if you imagine growing the square slowly with this measurement, it grows from the center outward, growing on all four sides.)	8
715	712	Actually, it is also true for squares (and for regular polygons in general!), the problem you ran into is what the equivalent of "r" is. The side length of a square is actually more comparable to the circle's diameter.Instead, the correct analogue of the circle's radius is the distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of one side, which is only half as long as the square's side.Here, we have A=(2r)2=4r2 and P=4*(2r)=8r.The perimeter is derivative of the area with respect to r, just as in the case of a circle.	32
716	Sum of the alternating harmonic series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} = \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2} + \cdots $	I know that the harmonic series $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}  = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} + \cdots \tag{I}$$ diverges, but what about the alternating harmonic series $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}  = \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{6} + \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} + \cdots \text{?} \tag{II}$$Does it converge?   If so, what is its sum?	27
717	716	it is not absolutely convergent (that is, if you are allowed to reorder terms you may end up with whatever number you fancy).If you consider the associated series formed by summing the terms from 1 to n of the original one, that is you fix the order of summation of the original series, that series (which is not the original one...) converges to $\ln(2)$ See Wikipedia.	6
718	716	Complementary to Mau's answer:Call a series $a_n$ absolutely convergent if $\sum|a_n|$ converges. If $a_n$ converges but is not absolutely convergent we call $a_n$ conditionally convergent The Riemann series theorem states that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to converge to any real number.Morally this is because both the positive and negative parts of your series diverge but the divergences cancel each other out, one or other's canceling the other can be staggered by adding on, say,  the negative bits every third term in stead of every other term. This means that in the race for the two divergences to cancel each other out, we give the positive bit something of a head-start and will get a larger positive outcome. Notice how, even in this rearranged version of the series, every term will still come up exactly once.It is also worth noting, on the Wikipedia link Mau provided, that the convergence to $\ln 2$ of your series is at the edge of the radius of convergence for the series expansion of $\ln(1-x)$- this is a fairly typical occurrence: at the boundary of a domain of convergence of a Taylor series, the series is only just converging- which is why you see this conditional convergence type behavior. 	19
719	704	Often the most obvious solution is the best solution. I would write T(s) be 1 if a statement is true and 0 if it is false. I would then call the statements A, B and C and let S={A, B, C}. Then is would write sum T(s) over S >=2 => all s are true. You can make these statement more symbolic if you really like	2
720	How to calculate a heading on the earths surface?	Given an initial position and a subsequent position, each given by latitude and longitude in the WGS-84 system.  How do you determine the heading in degrees clockwise from true north of movement?	6
721	Algorithm for calculating $A^n$ with as few multiplications as possible	Is there an algorithm for working out the best way (i.e. fewest multiplications) of calculating $A^n$ in a structure where multiplication is associative?For example, suppose $A$ is a square matrix. Matrix multiplication is associative, and I can compute $A^9$ with $4$ multiplications:$$A^2 = A \cdot A$$$$A^3 = A^2 \cdot A$$$$ A^6 = A^3  \cdot A^3 $$$$ A^9 = A^6 \cdot A^3 $$One method which works is to compute $A^{2^i}$ and use the binary representation of $n$, but this is not always optimal, e.g. with $n=23$, we can do it in $6$ multiplications:$$ A^2 = A \cdot A $$$$ A^3 = A^2 \cdot A $$$$ A^5 = A^3 \cdot A^2 $$$$ A^{10} = A^5 \cdot A^5 $$$$ A^{20} = A^{10} \cdot A^{10} $$$$ A^{23} = A^{20} \cdot A^3 $$rather than $7$:$$ A^2 = A\cdot A $$$$ A^4 = A^2 \cdot A^2 $$$$ A^8 = A^4 \cdot A^4 $$$$ A^{16} = A^8 \cdot A^8 $$$$ A^{20} = A^{16} \cdot A^4 $$$$ A^{22} = A^{20} \cdot A^2 $$$$ A^{23} = A^{22} \cdot A $$Is there an algorithm which gives the quickest way? 	19
722	721	There seems to be no efficient algorithm for this. Quoting Wikipedia on Addition-chain exponentiation:  … the addition-chain method is much more complicated, since the determination of a shortest addition chain seems quite difficult: no efficient optimal methods are currently known for arbitrary exponents, and the related problem of finding a shortest addition chain for a given set of exponents has been proven NP-complete.  Even given a shortest chain, addition-chain exponentiation requires more memory than the binary method, because it must potentially store many previous exponents from the chain simultaneously. In practice, therefore, shortest addition-chain exponentiation is primarily used for small fixed exponents for which a shortest chain can be precomputed and is not too large.On the same page, however, it does link to a reference* of some methods better than binary exponentiation.One simple example is to use base-N number instead of base-2. e.g. for A510,with binary:   2 = 1 + 1               3 = 2 + 1               6 = 3 + 3               7 = 6 + 1              14 = 7 + 7              15 = 14 + 1              30 = 15 + 15              31 = 30 + 1              62 = 31 + 31              63 = 62 + 1             126 = 63 + 63             127 = 126 + 1             254 = 127 + 127             255 = 254 + 1             510 = 255 + 255   (15 multiplications)with base-8:   2 = 1 + 1               3 = 2 + 1               4 = 3 + 1               5 = 4 + 1               6 = 5 + 1               7 = 6 + 1              14 = 7 + 7              28 = 14 + 14              56 = 28 + 28              63 = 56 + 7             126 = 63 + 63             252 = 126 + 126             504 = 252 + 252             510 = 504 + 6      (14 multiplications)with base-4:   2 = 1 + 1               3 = 2 + 1               4 = 2 + 2               7 = 4 + 3              14 = 7 + 7              28 = 14 + 14              31 = 28 + 3              62 = 31 + 31             124 = 62 + 62             127 = 124 + 3             254 = 127 + 127             508 = 254 + 254             510 = 508 + 2      (13 multiplications)(I don't know how to choose the optimal N.)*: Daniel M.

723	716	Let's  say you have a sequence of nonnegative numbers $a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \dots$ tending to zero. Then it is a theorem that the alternating sum $\sum (-1)^i a_i$ converges (not necessarily absolutely, of course).This in particular applies to your series.Incidentally, if you're curious why it converges to $\log(2)$ (which seems somewhat random), it's because of the Taylor series of $\log(1+x)$ while letting $x \to 1$.	4
724	713	While tensors are generalizations of vectors, I don't think you can really generalize the way you visualize them.  This is because you really want to think of tensors as multi-linear functions and you usually don't think of a vector as a linear function from the dual space to the real numbers.So even if you can't get as nice a geometric picture of a tensor, you do get a nice grasp on what they are if you view them as multi-linear functions (as opposed to just a collection of numbers) from some copies of your vector space V (and/or its dual V*) into R.  For example, a metric is a type of rank 2 tensor and has a nice geometric meaning-- applying it to two copies of a vector gives the vectors squared length, you can apply to to two vectors to get the angle between them, etc.  The moment of inertia tensor is a 2-tensor I such that I(u,u) is the moment of inertia about the u-axis.There are also usually different ways of looking at the same tensor, which may make it easier to get a grasp on it.  For example, a (1,1) tensor is a multilinear map from V x V* into R.  However, this can naturally (i.e. basis independently) be identified with a linear map from V to itself: if T is a (1,1) tensor then contracting it with a vector gives a linear map V* to R, which is just another vector.	4
725	701	I had an answer before, but I looked into it a bit more and my answer was incorrect so I removed it. This link may be of interest: Circle Packing in a Square (wikipedia)It was suggested by KennyTM that there may not be an optimal solution yet to this problem in general. Further digging into this has shown me that this is probably correct. Check out this page: Circle Packing - Best Known Packings. As you can see, solutions up to only 30 circles have been found and proven optimal. (Other higher numbers of circles have been proven optimal, but 31 hasn't)Note that although problem defined on the wikipedia page and the other link is superficially different than the question asked here, the same fundamental question is being asked, which is "what is the most efficient way to pack circles in a square/rectangle container?"....And it seems the answer is "we don't really know" :)	7
726	What are NP-complete problems and why are they so important?	I keep hearing questions about whether something is NP-complete, but they never really mention what it is. Why do people care so much about NP-complete problems?	15
727	726	A problem is in class NP if its solution may be verified in polynomial time, that is if the dimension of the problem is n you may be sure that for large enough n you need less than r·nk operations to verify the solution. A problem is in class P if its solution may be found in polynomial time, instead. A problem in P is in NP by definition, but the converse may not be the case; probably the most important open question in computer science is whether classes P and NP are the same, that is P=NP. NP-complete is a family of NP problems for which you know that if one of them had a polynomial solution then everyone of them has. (EDITED) For the time being, only known algorithms for NP-complete problems are exponential in number of operations, so they are not practically solvable for n large.	17
728	726	To expand on Mau's answer, you should care about NP-complete problems because there is an entire family of them that spans a large number of seemingly basic algorithms across a wide range of disciplines. These aren't obscure problems, but extremely important and highly practical questions. For examples, consider the following:Travelling salesman problem - finding the shortest path (on a graph) that allows you to visit every city exactly once.Bin packing problem - there are a number of fixed (integer) size bins and objects of varying sizes. Minimise the number of bins required to hold all of the objectsKnapsack problem - given objects of various sizes and values and a knapsack with a fixed integer size, choose the objects that can fit inside with the most valueMinimal Vertex cover - finding the smallest set of vertices such that every edge contains at least one chosen verticeClique - finding that largest group of people who all know each otherSubgraph isomorphism - does one graph contain a subgraph isomorphic to another?Set packing - given a number of sets, what is the maximum number of disjoint sets that can be selected? This is related to set cover, where we are trying to choose sets so that every element is within at least one setSubset sum - Given a set of integers, does some subset sum to 0?Although many of these problems may seem abstract, many more complicated problems can't be efficiently solved with current techniques, as they are equivalent to one of these.The problem of NP completeness has received a huge amount of attention. Once you've reduced a problem to NP-complete, you know to give up on an efficient fast algorithm and to start looking at approximations.	14
729	726	Any problem for which a solution (once found) can be quickly verified as a solution is said to be "in NP"  (Here, "quickly" means in polynomial-time).  Any problem for which a solution can be found quickly is said to be "in P."  P is a subset of NP - that is, any problem for which a solution can be quickly found can also be quickly verified.A problem is NP-complete if it is the hardest problem in NP.  Surprisingly, there are many NP-complete problems, which are all equivalent - here, equivalent means that a quick (polynomial-time) solution to any one of them would give you a quick solution to all the rest.  Also somewhat surprisingly, a quick solution to any NP-complete problem would also give you a quick solution to any problem in NP.So is there a quick (polynomial-time) algorithm to solve NP-complete problems?  That is the P=NP problem, one of the greatest unsolved problems of our time.  However, most sane mathemeticians believe (and hope!) that P≠NP, because proving math-theorems is NP-Complete; so if P=NP, we'd be out of a job! :)	6
731	721	Another option would be to use eigendecomposition . It allows you to raise the eigenvalues in the diagonal of the decomposition A = VDV^-1 to a power. It changes the problem from matrix multiplication to the multiplication of the eigenvalues. Once in eigendecomposition form you could perform the same addition-chain exponentiation technique but it would be with scalars, not matrices. Much more efficient, because each matrix multiplication has n^3 multiplies, but with ed you would only have n.More is explained here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition#Eigendecomposition	2
732	Proof that the irrational numbers are uncountable	Can someone point me to a proof that the set of irrational numbers is uncountable? I know how to show that the set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is countable, but how would you show that the irrationals are uncountable?	35
733	732	Given that the reals are uncountable (which can be shown via Cantor diagonalization) and the rationals are countable, the irrationals are the reals with the rationals removed, which is uncountable. (Or, since the reals are the union of the rationals and the irrationals, if the irrationals were countable, the reals would be the union of two countable sets and would have to be countable, so the irrationals must be uncountable.)	59
735	What does it mean to be going 40 mph (or 64 kph, etc.) at a given moment?	I was coming back from my Driver's Education class, and something mathsy really stuck out to me.One of the essential properties of a car is its current speed.  Or speed at a current time.  For example, at a given point in time in my drive, I could be traveling 40 mph.  But what does that mean?From my basic algebra classes, I've learned that speed = distance/time.  So if I travel ten miles in half an hour, my average speed would be $20$ mph ($\frac{10 mi}{25 h}$).But instantaneous velocity...you aren't measuring average speed for a given amount of time.  You're measuring instantaneous speed over an...instantaneous amount of time.That would be something like (miles) / (time), where time = $0$?  Isn't that infinite?And perhaps, in a difference of time = $0$, then I'd be travelling $0$ miles.  So would I be said to be going $0$ mph at an instantaneous moment in time?  I'd like to be able to tell that to any cops pull me over for "speeding"!But then if miles = $0$ and time = $0$, then you have $\frac00$?This is all rather confusing.  What does it mean to be going $40$ mph at a given moment in time, exactly?I've heard this explained using this strange art called "calculus" before, and it's all gone over my head.  Can anyone explain this using terms I (a High School Algebra and Geometry and Driving student) will understand?(I figured that my problem had numbers in it, and therefore has to do with Maths.)	13
737	735	If you were to try to measure instantaneous speed as you described, you would in fact have traveled 0 miles in 0 time and 0/0 is undefined  If, however, you look at your average speed over smaller and smaller periods of time around the instant you care about--that is, (distance traveled from $t=t_0$ to $t=t_0+\epsilon$ for various small values of ε--and these average speeds "converge" (they all get closer to a single value as ε gets closer to 0), then we say that the instantaneous speed is that single value upon which the average speeds around that point converge.  This is, of course, a somewhat informal explanation; to be more precise requires getting into differential calculus.	13
738	735	in the real world you need a bit of time to brake or accelerate. This means that in a small amount of time (let's say 1/10 of a second) your speed is more or less constant. So, instead of dividing by 0 seconds, just take a small elapsed time and do the division.In calculus you will learn how to be more precise, noticing that using a smaller and smaller elapsed time the ratio between distance and time changes less and less; at that point you postulate that in this scenario only you may say that the limit (which is 0/0 and therefore indefinite) is the instantaneous speed. But the odometers don't care for instantaneous speed, so for the moment you shouldn't worry.	3
739	735	I think there is a very clear meaning in the physical world: If, at some moment, you were going 40 mph, if you were to stop de/accelerating and just hold that velocity, you would cover 40 miles in 1 hour.	17
740	Useful examples of pathological functions	What are some particularly well-known functions that exhibit pathological behavior at or near at least one value and are particularly useful as examples?For instance, if $f'(a) = b$, then $f(a)$ exists, $f$ is continuous at $a$, $f$ is differentiable at $a$, but $f'$ need not be continuous at $a$.  A function for which this is true is $f(x) = x^2 \sin(1/x)$ at $x=0$.	22
741	What is linear programming?	I asked this question on Stack Overflow but it was closed as "not programming related". So I think this is probably the best place for it...I read over the wikipedia article, but it seems to be beyond my comprehension. It says it's for optimization, but how is it different than any other method for optimizing things?An answer that introduces me to linear programming so I can begin diving into some less beginner-accessible material would be most helpful.	7
742	Least wasteful use of stamps to achieve a given postage	  You have sheets of $42$-cent stamps and  $29$-cent stamps, but you need at least  $\$3.20$ to mail a package.  What is the  least amount you can make with the $42$-  and $29$-cent stamps that is sufficient  to mail the package?A contest problem such as this is probably most easily solved by tabulating the possible combinations, using $0$ through ceiling(total/greater value) of the greater-value stamp and computing the necessary number of the smaller stamp and the total postage involved.  The particular example above would be solved with a $9$-row table, showing the minimum to be $\$3.23$, made with seven $42$-cent stamps and one $29$-cent stamp.Is there a better algorithm for solving this kind of problem?  What if you have more than two values of stamps?	6
743	741	The standard form (and example) sections pretty well describe what it is.  How is it different than any other method for optimizing things?It's, well, just another method.  However, it is somewhat special in that many other optimization algorithms either use linear programming as part of their solution, or are in reality a specialized solution to a linear programming problem.  In fact, integer linear programming is NP-complete, meaning that any problem in NP can be stated as an (integer) linear programming problem.(this also means solving your typical integer linear programming problem is much more difficult than if we didn't restrict ourselves to integers..)	6
744	735	A state-variable kind of approach: (represents the physical states of a system)Newton's first law of motion says that without external forces, masses will move at constant velocity. Every change in velocity (for a car, whether a change in speed due to braking, or a change in direction due to friction of the tires and the steering mechanism) is due to an external force. So the "state" of the car at any instant in time is its velocity; distance traveled can be derived from velocity:While you are going 60mi/hr = 26.8m/sec (see conversion factors) in a particular direction at constant velocity, you can multiply a change in time times velocity and get distance: 26.8m/sec = 26.8 meters in one second. Or 26.8mm in one millisecond. Or 26.8 micrometers in one microsecond.The process of going from velocity to (directed) distance is called integration, and for those two variables (velocity and directed distance) is just the summing up of distance increments (= velocity * time increments) over infinitesimally short periods of time. For smoothly varying velocities, coarse time increments are a good approximation to reality -- differential equation solvers use this or similar approaches (e.g. Simpson's Rule) to perform integration.  But instantaneous velocity...you aren't measuring average speed for a given amount of timeWell, instantaneous velocity is just the limit of average velocity as the time period becomes infinitely small.	1
745	741	BlueRaja's answer is certainly more complete than this one (and gives good references), but here's a rough overview of linear programming.  Suppose that you have a linear function (in high school courses, it's typically a function of two variables) that you want to optimize on a convex "feasible" region bounded by linear equations (again, in high school, the bounds are typically described using linear inequalities in two variables).Because the function to optimize is linear, the set of points for which the function has a particular value, say c, is a line (and all such lines are parallel) and the value of the function anywhere to one side of the line is greater than c and anywhere to the other side of the line is less than c.  So, you can think about moving through this set of constant-value lines to increase/decrease the value of the target function as appropriate to optimize it.Since the feasible region is bounded by linear equations, as the constant-value line moves through and out of the feasible region, it last touches the feasible region at a vertex (or possibly at all points on an edge connecting two vertices), so the optimal solution must occur at a vertex of the feasible region.Given all that, linear programming comes down to evaluating the target function at all the vertices of the feasible region to find the optimal value.	4
746	742	With two stamps, you can do it in linear pseudo-linear time - O(totalCost/costOfLargerStamp) - by simply enumerating every possibility (there is only one possible count of the smaller stamp for each count of the larger stamp).In general, however, solving this is equivalent to solving a general integer linear programming problem written in standard form, which is NP-complete.	2
747	740	$\displaystyle\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ is useful; it has a singularity at $x=0$, but if you take the union of $\displaystyle y=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ with the point $(x=0,y=1)$ then you get $\text{sinc}(x/\pi)$. The $\text{sinc}$ function has a lot of applications in signal processing and diffraction.	3
748	740	The Dirac delta "function." It's not a "function," strictly speaking, but rather a very simple example of a distribution that isn't a function.	4
749	742	This is a simple variation of the Knapsack problem. Which is a NP-Complete problem.Let n to be the target value, it can be solve using knapsack's dynamic programming solutions.If you have a finite amount of stamps, then you can add them all up, subtract the target value. Run 0-1 knapsack on the stamps with the resulting number. The stamps outside the knapsack is the solution.If you have a infinite amount of stamps. You can either make them finite: $\lceil \frac{n}{t_i}\rceil$ stamps for stamps with value $t_i$ and run the above process, or you can compute the result by running knapsacks O(log n) times similar to a binary search.It's no better than a naive backtracking solution when n is large. I assume you are not going to pay $100 for stamps. ;)	-1
750	Determinants and volume of parallelotopes	The absolute value of a $2 \times 2$ matrix determinant is the area of a corresponding parallelogram with the $2$ row vectors as sides.The absolute value of a $3 \times 3$ matrix determinant is the volume of a corresponding parallelepiped with the $3$ row vectors as sides.Can it be generalized to $n-D$? The absolute value of an $n \times n$ matrix determinant is the volume of a corresponding $n-$parallelotope?	4
751	735	This is similar to other answers. Imagine another car beside yours. That car is covering a distance of 40 miles over the next hour at a constant velocity. At the point at which you keep pace with that car (relative velocity = 0), you are traveling at 40 mph.	5
752	750	Yes--see the Wikipedia article.This follows from the change of variables formula with the Jacobian. However, it is probably more accurate to say that the change-of-variables formula is a (nontrivial) consequence of this.  One argument for this fact, which is given in Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis, is the fact that both the determinant and the volume function up to sign behave very nicely satisfying certain specific properties (i.e., multilinear, alternating, normalized) hence are the same.	3
753	750	Yes, that is because in its most general form the determinate is defined that way, except without the absolute value part. The determinant is a way to compare volumes of subspaces that have the same grade, which is the multi-vector equivalent of the size of matrix.	1
754	750	Yes it can. In fact, as Katie Banks noted, a determinant is an intuitive way of thinking about volumes. To summarise her argument, if we consider the vectors as a matrix, switching two rows, multiplying one by a constant or adding a linear combination will have the same effect on the volume as on the determinate. We can use these operations to transform any n-parallelotope to cube and note that the determinate matches the signed volume here, so it will match it everywhere as well.	5
755	742	It is important to understand that NP-completeness is defined in terms of input size, not in terms of either cost to be paid, C, or the number of types of stamps, S, when we are dealing with integers rather than real numbers.This algorithm can actually be solved in time CS. We take the first stamp value an mark all multiple of it as obtainable (up to the least number greater than the cost). Then, for each subsequent stamp value, we mark as obtainable all numbers that can be obtained by adding a multiple of its value with an obtainable number (up to the least number greater than the cost). We can keep track of the lowest cost postage amount that we have found so far.	1
756	Twenty questions against a liar	Here's one that popped into my mind when I was thinking about binary search.I'm thinking of an integer between 1 and n. You have to guess my number. You win as soon as you guess the correct number. If your guess is not correct, I'll give you a hint by saying "too high" or "too low". What's your best strategy?This is an easy problem if I always tell the truth: by guessing the (rounded) mean of the lower bound and the upper bound, you can find my number in roughly log2 n guesses at most.But what if I'm allowed to cheat once? What is your best strategy then? To clarify: if you guess my number, you always win instantly. But I'm allowed, at most once, to tell you "too high" when your guess is actually too low, or the opposite. I can also decide not to lie.Here's a rough upper bound: you can ask each number twice to make sure I'm not cheating, and if I ever give two different answers, just ask a third time and from then on, play the regular game. In this way, you can win with about 2 log2 n guesses at most.I'm pretty sure that bound can be improved. Any ideas?	13

758	734	I would recommend against getting a degree from any online-only university. Even if you happen to find one that's not shady, everyone else who hasn't heard of it will assume it is some kind of diploma mill without bothering to do much research. Instead, I think you'd be better off going to a nearby university you're interested in, and ask them if they would be willing to make some kind of special arrangement for you. Many universities allow reduced course loads for students that have families or work full time, and aren't very good about advertising it.	6

760	How do I measure distance on a globe?	I have a $3$-D sphere of radius $R$, centered at the origin. $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and$(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ are two points on the sphere. The Euclidean distance is easy to calculate, but what if I were to restrict myself to traveling on the surface of the sphere?  Two approaches come to mind: use arc-length in some way, or simply use trigonometry: calculate the angle between the two points and get a distance from that.  Will both/either of these methods work? Which would be easier?Somewhat related to this question. Maybe it will inspire someone to go answer it!	5
761	Using differential equations to graph velocity over time of a falling object subject to wind resistance	Wind resistance -- upwards acceleration, typically varies either linearly or quadratically by the current velocity.There is a constant downward acceleration due to gravity.How can we model the velocity over time of a falling object, subject only to wind resistance and downwards gravity?I don't have much experience with differential equations, but I do know that this answer necessarily involves it, so could you possibly explain every step?Thank you.	1
762	760	What you are looking for is what is called the great circle distance: the shortest curve connecting two points on the surface of a sphere is given by traveling along the (there will be exactly one unless the points are polar opposites)  arc of the great circle (that is, the circle of radius $R$) connecting them.  So, you do need to find an arc length but it is easy to do this without invoking calculus if you know about the dot product.  Suppose the two points on the circle are represented by the vectors $v$ and $w$.  If $v\cdot w$ denotes the dot product of these two vectors, then the angle between them will be:$\cos^{-1}\left(\large\frac{v\cdot w}{R^2}\right)$ (we divide by $R^2$ since $v$ and $w$ have length $R$).  Assuming this is in radians, to get the length of the arc connecting them we just multiply this angle by $R$ to get:$R\cos^{-1}\left(\large\frac{v\cdot w}{R^2}\right)$.We are quite lucky that there is such a simple formula.  For most manifolds, the curves that minimize distances are not very easy to find since it involves solving a non-linear differential equation (the geodesic equation).  The fact that the sphere is so symmetric helps in this case, and you can maybe convince yourself that an arc of a great circle minimizes distance.You may find this wikipedia article interesting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic.	11

It's a bit difficult to summarize the techniques in general, but any good book on differential equations would cover them.	2
764	Riemann vs. Stieltjes Integral	From Rudin's PMA:6.2 Definition  Let $\alpha$ be a monotonically increasing function on $[a,b]$. ... Corresponding to each partition $P$ of $[a,b]$, we write$\Delta \alpha_i = \alpha(x_i) - \alpha(x_{i-1})$.He then goes on to define the Riemann Stieltjes integral of $f$ with respect to $\alpha$, over the interval $[a,b]$.  The Riemann integral is then pointed out to be a special case of this when $\alpha(x)=x$.With $\alpha(x)=x$, I understand $\Delta x = x_i - x_{i-1}$ to represent the directed magnitude of the "base of the approximating rectangle" that we then multiply by the value of $f$ taken somewhere within this interval, thus obtaining the area of an approximating rectangle.  I don't know where to begin to interpret the case where $\alpha(x) \not\equiv x$.  	10
765	764	The idea is that we define a different way of measuring the width of the rectangle. Instead of using the difference of the two coordinates, we take the difference of the images of those two coordinates under the map $\alpha$.  Basically, the idea is that the $(x_i-x_{i-1})$ is to be interpreted as the width or measure of the interval, a construction which leads more generally to the Lebesgue measure of a subset of the reals.  The $\alpha(x_i)-\alpha(x_{i-1})$ leads to a different measure, starting with a different assignment of "size" to an interval.Note that when $\alpha$ is continuously differentiable, then $\alpha(x_i) -\alpha(x_{i-1})$ is equal to $\alpha'(x) (x_i - x_{i-1})$ for $x \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$ up to higher order terms. So in this case the Stieltjes integral with respect to $\alpha$ is the Riemann integral of the same function times $\alpha'$.	13
766	RHS Congruency test - What makes 90 degrees different?	RHS is a well known test for determining the congruency of triangles. It is easy enough to prove it works, simply use Pythagorus' theorem to reduce to SSS. I thought that it seems strange that this only works for an angle being 90 degrees - or does it? What if I tried changed the given angle to 89 degrees or 91 degrees, would it still be uniquely identified up to congruence?	6
767	766	Supposing that we knew two triangles had one angle congruent, a side adjacent to the angle congruent, and the side opposite the angle congruent.  This is sometimes referred to as SSA, which is not a congruence theorem (and I've heard it said that it is "ass-backwards").  With a little more information, it is possible to determine congruence in some instances.As you'd said about RHS, in that case you can use right-triangle trigonometry to determine that the unknown sides are congruent, then use SSS to establish congruence.  Without the right angle, the technique for determining the length of the third side of the triangle is to use the Law of Sines to determine the measure of the unknown angle opposite the known side, use that to find the measure of the third angle, then use the Law of Cosines to determine the length of the unknown side.Let's call one of the triangles ABC with ∠A and AB and BC being known.  From the Law of Sines, $\frac{\sin A}{BC}=\frac{\sin C}{AB}$ or $\sin C=\frac{AB\cdot\sin A}{BC}$.  There will be two values of C in the range 0° to 180° that satisfy this equation, unless sin C = 1.  So:if sin C = 1, then C is a right angle, the triangle is uniquely determined, so congruence can be established;if A ≥ 90°, C < 90°, so there is only one solution for C that makes sense in this triangle, the triangle is uniquely determined, and congruence can be established (one might call this SSobtuseA);if A < 90°, but BC ≥ AB, then B ≥ C (in a triangle, the largest/smallest side is opposite the largest/smallest angle), so the only solution for C that makes sense in this triangle is the one with C < 90° (if B ≥ C > 90°, then A + B + C > 180°), the triangle is uniquely determined, and congruence can be established (one might call this SsA, with the relative sizes of the S/s indicating the relative lengths);otherwise (when A < 90° and BC < AB), there are two possible values for C, both of which lead to triangles, so there are two possible triangles satisfying the given information, and congruence cannot be established.So, to your specific question, if the angle were 91° (case 2), congruence would follow; if the angle were 89°, congruence may or may not follow, depending on what you can determine about the other sides.As an aside, RHS is also commonly referred to (at least in the midwestern U.S. in contemporary high school geometry) as hypotenuse-leg or HL.	6
768	Pick's Theorem on a triangular (or hex) grid	Pick's theorem says that given a square grid consisting of all points in the plane with integer coordinates, and a polygon without holes and non selt-intersecting whose vertices are grid points, its area is given by: $$i + \frac{b}{2} - 1$$where $i$ is the number of interior lattice points and $b$ is the number of points on its boundary. Theorem and proof may be found on Wikipedia.Let us suppose that the grid is not square but triangular (or hexagonal). Does a similar theorem hold?	22
769	664	$dm$ takes density fluctuations into account, it's just $dm = \rho(\vec r) d^3r$.E.g. for a homogeneous cylinder with the rotational axis align parallel to the z-axis it is $\rho = \frac{m}{V}\cdot\theta(R-r)\theta(z^2-a^2)$, where $\theta(x) = \begin{cases} 0 for x<0 and\ 1 for x>0 \end{cases}$ and $r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is the radial coordinate in cylindrical coordinates. The result is that your integration over $r$ is from 0 to R and for z from -a to a. $V=\pi R^2 \cdot 2a$ is the volume of the cylinder, $m$ its weight. In cylindrical coordinates, $d^3r = r dr d\phi dz$, so you got$I = \int_{r=0}^{R} \int_{z=-a}^a \int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} r^2 \frac{m}{V} \cdot r d\phi dz dr = 4a\pi \frac{m}{V} \int_{r=0}^R r^3 dr = \frac{am\pi}{V}R^4 = \frac{1}{2}mR^2$.	1
770	720	First, some background.  A "line" (the object containing the path of least distance between two points) on a sphere is a great circle; a great circle is the intersection of a sphere with a plane passing through the center of the sphere.  A spherical triangle is the triangle formed by the spherical line segments connecting three non-collinear points on a sphere.  Below is the Spherical Law of Cosines as it appears in UCSMP Functions, Statistics, and Trigonometry, 3rd ed., copied here because the diagram is good and helps with clarity.If ABC is a spherical triangle with arcs a, b, and c (meaning the measures of the arcs, not the lengths), then cos c = cos a * cos b + sin a * sin b * cos C.Now, to the specific problem at hand.  Let's use the diagram below, also from UCSMP Functions, Statistics, and Trigonometry, 3rd ed., for reference.Let B be the initial point and A be the final point of the movement (and for simplicity, I'll assume they are both in the northern hemisphere, and leave extending the solution to any points as an exercise); N and S are the north and south poles, respectively; C and D are the points on the equator that are on the same line of longitude as A and B, respectively.  Consider spherical triangle ABN.  a = (90° - latitude of point A); b = (90° - latitude of point B). N = positive difference in longitude between points A and B.  Use the Spherical Law of Cosines (cos n = ... form) to determine n, then use the Spherical Law of Cosines (cos b = ... form) to determine B.  If the points are arranged as pictured, the heading of travel from B to A is 360° - B; for other arrangements of the points, the exact method of determining the heading based on the measure of angle B may vary.(graphics from Lesson 5-10 of UCSMP Functions, Statistics, and Trigonometry, 3rd ed., © 2010 Wright Group/McGraw Hill)	7
771	Expected value of a function of a random variable: help!	I am trying to show the following: \begin{equation*}E[e^{-\gamma W}]=e^{-\gamma(E[W]-\frac{\gamma}{2}Var [W])}\end{equation*}but I really can't remember what I am supposed to do to get from the LHS to the RHS. I have tried using integration this way\begin{equation*}\int We^{-\gamma W}dW\end{equation*}and then use integration by parts, but even though what I get resembles it, it can't be correct (because $e^{-\gamma W}$ is not the distribution of W).I have also tried using Taylor series expansion, but I think I am way off, and I don't think an approximation here is what I need, because the equality above is exact.FYI, this is not homework, I am working through a paper (page 10) and I would really like to know how every step was derived.Can anyone at least point me to the right direction?EDIT: This expectation on the RHS is very similar to the moment generating function formula (with a negative exponent). If you check here, you will see that the moment generating function for the normal distribution is like the LHS (but with a positive sign). So in a way I have my answer, but I still would like to know how to derive it, if there is a way. I know little if anything at all about moment generating functions, so maybe I shouldn't try and derive it but rather just use the result? Does it even make sense to try and derive it?	6
772	768	This is a very interesting question. I don't have a complete solution yet, but I did get some results. Consider an arbitrary distribution of points. Let $P(i,b)=i+\frac{b}{2}-1$ where $i$ is the number of internal points and $P$ is the number of boundary points. Let $P(A)=P(i_A,b_A)$, where $A$ is a simple polygon with all its vertices on the points. Wikipedia shows that $P(C)=P(A)+P(T)$ where $T$ is a triangle that shares a single edge with $A$ and $C$ a simple polygon formed by the union of $A$ and $T$. Since all simple polygons can be triangulated, $P(C)=sum P(t)$ for all $t$ in the triangulation of $C$.The proof then has a second part that shows $P(t)$ equals the area for any triangle. So if we want to generalize it for other grids, we have to find a property equal to $P(T)$ for any triangle.	2
773	768	The short answer is that, no, there can be no formula for polygons with vertices in the hexagonal lattice in terms of just boundary and interior points. This is based on the fact that primitive triangles on this lattice--ones with no lattice points on their boundary (besides the vertices) or in the interior--can have different areas, whereas for the square lattice all primitive triangles have area $\frac{1}{2}$.However, as Casebash has partly gotten at in his answer, you can approximate things well if you compute what, in the below paper, is called the "boundary characteristic" of the polygon, a number that is somewhat complicated to think to compute, but which gives a decent proxy for how many of each type of primitive triangle the polygon contains.Kolodziejczyk has been the main one doing work on hexagonal lattice results of this type that I know; he's worth looking up for similar results. Ding Ren is another, and the older work of Grunbaum, etc., still bears on the problem."A Fast Pick-Type Approximation for the Area of H-Polygons," Ren, Kolodziejczyk, et al., American Mathematical Monthly, 1993.	13
774	764	To add to Akhil's answer, the Stieltjes integral made a lot more sense to me when I started thinking about it in terms of physics. Think of taking something like the integral you get to determine moment of inertia, where it's mass--a function of position--you're integrating over, and not position itself.	7
775	771	If W is randomly chosen with the PDF P(x), then the expectation value should be   $E[e^{-\gamma W}]=\int_{-\infty}^\infty P(x) e^{-\gamma x} dx$ http://mathcache.appspot.com/?tex=%5cpng%5c%5bE%5Be%5E%7B-%5Cgamma%20W%7D%5D%3D%5Cint_%7B-%5Cinfty%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20P%28x%29%20e%5E%7B-%5Cgamma%20x%7D%20dx%5c%5dAnd I think that equation (E[e-γW] = e-γ(E[W] - ½γVar[W])) is correct only when W is a normal distribution.	4
776	Proof of Angle in a Semi-Circle is of $90$ degrees	There is a well known theorem often stated as the angle in a semi-circle being $90$ degrees. To be more accurate, any triangle with one of its sides being a diameter and all vertices on the circle has its angle opposite the diameter being $90$ degrees. The standard proof uses isosceles triangles and is worth having as an answer, but there is also a much more intuitive proof as well (this proof is more complicated though).	6
777	776	Nonstandard proofConsider the semi-circle with endpoints A and C and center O and the inscribed angle ∠ABC (B on the semi-circle) together with the rotation image of both about O by 180°.  The image of A is C and vice versa; let B' be the image of B.  The image of a line under a 180° rotation is parallel to the original line, AB is parallel to CB' and BC is parallel to B'A, so ABCB' is a parallelogram.  BO and its image must be parallel, but the image of O is itself, since it is the center of rotation, and if BO and B'O are parallel and contain a point in common, they must lie on the same line, so BB' passes through O.  AC and BB' (the diagonals of ABCB') are both diameters of the circle, so they are congruent.  A parallelogram with congruent diagonals is a rectangle.  Thus, ∠ABC is a right angle (and has measure 90°).diagram http://www.imgftw.net/img/762828246.pngStandard proof (or, at least, my guess at it based on the description in the question)As above, consider the semi-circle with endpoints A and C and center O and the inscribed angle ∠ABC (B on the semi-circle).  Draw in radius OB.  OA = OB, so △AOB is isosceles and ∠OAB≅∠OBA.  OB = OC, so △BOC is isosceles and ∠OBC≅∠OCB.  Let α=m∠OAB=m∠OBA and β=m∠OBC=m∠OCB.  In △ABC, the measures of the angles are α, α+β, and β, so α+(α+β)+β=180° or 2(α+β)=180° or α+β=90°, so ∠ABC has measure 90° and is a right angle.diagram http://www.imgftw.net/img/319527897.pngedit: Another Nonstandard proofUse the labeling as above and apply Stewart's Theorem to △ABC: $$(AB)^2(OC) + (BC)^2(AO) = (AC)((BO)^2 + (AO)(OC))$$  Substituting the length r of the radius of the semicircle as appropriate: $$(AB)^2r + (BC)^2r = 2r(r^2 + r^2)=4r^3$$  Dividing both sides by r: $$(AB)^2+(BC)^2=(2r)^2=(AC)^2$$So, by the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem, ∠ABC is a right angle.	14
778	756	Look at this answer on MathOverflow:  Yes, there is a way to guess a number asking 14 questions in worst case. To do it you need a linear code with length 14, dimension 10 and distance at least 3. One such code can be built based on Hamming code (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code).  Here is the strategy.  Let us denote bits of first player's number as ai, i ∈ [1..10]. We start with asking values of all those bits. That is we ask the following questions: "is it true that i-th bit of your number is zero?" Let us denote answers on those questions as bi, i ∈ [1..10].  Now we ask 4 additional questions:  Is it true that a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ a4 ⊗ a5 ⊗ a7 ⊗ a9 is equal to zero? (⊗ is sumation modulo 2).  Is it true that a1 ⊗ a3 ⊗ a4 ⊗ a6 ⊗ a7 ⊗ a10 is equal to zero?  Is it true that a2 ⊗ a3 ⊗ a4 ⊗ a8 ⊗ a9 ⊗ a10 is equal to zero?  Is it true that a5 ⊗ a6 ⊗ a7 ⊗ a8 ⊗ a9 ⊗ a10 is equal to zero?  Let q1, q2, q3 and q4 be answers on those additional questions. Now second player calculates ti (i ∈ [1..4]) --- answers on those questions based on bits bj which he previously got from first player.  Now there are 16 ways how bits qi can differ from ti. Let di = qi ⊗ ti (hence di = 1 iff qi ≠ ti ).  Let us make table of all possible errors and corresponding values of di:  position of error -> (d1, d2, d3, d4)  no error -> (0, 0, 0, 0)  error in b1 -> (1, 1, 0, 0)  error in b2 -> (1, 0, 1, 0)  error in b3 -> (0, 1, 1, 0)  error in b4 -> (1, 1, 1, 0)  error in b5 -> (1, 0, 0, 1)  error in b6 -> (0, 1, 0, 1)  error in b7 -> (1, 1, 0, 1)  error in b8 -> (0, 0, 1, 1)  error in b9 -> (1, 0, 1, 1)  error in b10 -> (0, 1, 1, 1)  error in q1 -> (1, 0, 0, 0)  error in q2 -> (0, 1, 0, 0)  error in q3 -> (0, 0, 1, 0)  error in q4 -> (0, 0, 0, 1)  All the values of (d1, d2, d3, d4) are different. Hence we can find where were an error and hence find all ai.Answered by falagar.	8
779	742	Let t be your target and a and b < a be the values of the stamps you have. Let n = ⌈t/a⌉ be the maximum number of a stamps it makes sense to use.For each number i from n to 0, consider the cost of the solution with:i stamps of value a andj = ⌈(t - i*a) / b⌉ stamps of value bThe cost of each solution would obviously be i*a + j*b.Your solution is the pair (i, ⌈(t - i*a) / b⌉ ) that minimizes said cost. (Note there's only one unknown in that pair, i.)An additional optimization would be to stop immediately as soon as a division without rest is performed, either when determining n or j. A division without rest means that we have found a solution that perfectly pays the due amount and cannot thus be improved on. (There may be others like it, but none that is actually better, so there's no need to keep searching).	1
780	631	This is still WIP. There are a few missing details, still I think it's better than nothing. Feel free to edit in the missing details.Given a problem of SUBSET-SUM. We have a set of A={a1,a2,...,an} numbers, and another number s. The question we're seeking answer to is, whether or not there's a subset of A whose sum is s.I'm assuming that the 24-game allows you to use rational numbers. Even if it doesn't, I think that it is possible to emulate rational numbers up to denominator of size p with integers.We know that SUBSET-SUM is NP-complete even for integers only. I think the SUBSET-SUM problem is NP-hard even if you allow treating each ai as a negative number. That is even if A is of the form A={a1,-a1,a2,-a2,...,an,-an}. This is still a wrinkle I need to iron out in this reduction.Obviously, if there's a subset of A with sum s, then there's a solution to the 24-problem for how to reach using A to s. The solution is only using the + sign.The problem is, what happens if there's no solution which only uses the + sign, but there is a solution which uses other arithmetic operations.Let us consider the following problem. Let's take a prime p which is larger than n, the total number of elements in A. Given an oracle which solves the 24-problem, and a SUBSET-SUM problem of A={a1,a2,...,an} and s. We'll ask the oracle to solve the 24-problem on  A={a1+(1/p),a2+(1/p),...,an+(1/p)}for the following values:  s1=s+1/p,s2=s+2/p,...,sn=s+n/p.If the solution includes multiplication, we will have a denominator larger than p in the end result, and thus we will not be able to reach any si.Given an arithmetric expression that contains aiaj=x+(1/p2), It is impossible that the denominator p2 would "cancel" out, since there are at most n elements in the summation, and thus the numerator would never reach p, since p>n.THIS IS NOT QUIT RIGHT! The expression aiaj-akal will be an integer, and therefor our oracle might return answer which includes two multiplications one negative and one positive.What about division? How can we be sure no division will occur. Find another prime q which is different than p, and larger than the largest ai times n. Multiply all answers by q. The set A will be  A={qa1+(1/p),qa2+(1/p),...,qan+(1/p)}We will look for the following values:  s1=qs+1/p,s2=qs+2/p,...,sn=qs+n/p.In that case, ai/aj will be smaller than the minimal element in A, and therefor the end result which will contains ai/aj will never be one of the si we're looking for.	5
781	Why does Benford's Law (or Zipf's Law) hold?	Both Benford's Law (if you take a list of values, the distribution of the most significant digit is rougly proportional to the logarithm of the digit) and Zipf's Law (given a corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is roughly inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table) are not theorems in a mathematical sense, but they work quite good in the real life. Does anyone have an idea why this happens?(see also this question)	21
782	781	For the case of Bendford's Law, of course scale invariance is a necessary condition; it the law must be true either if we measure things in meters or in feet or in furlongs, thus multiplying given data for a constant, the only distribution which allows this is the logarithmic one. But its being necessary does not mean that it is the answer, of course.Scale invariance is not relevant for Zipf's Law, however, since we have an absolute rank.	8
783	Isomorphism and $\mathrm{id}$	In a category I have two objects $a$ and $b$ and a morphism $m$ from $a$ to $b$ and one $n$ from $b$ to $a$. Is this always an isomorphism? Why is it emphasized that this has to be true, too: $m \circ n = \mathrm{id}_b$ and $n \circ m = \mathrm{id}_a$?I am looking for an example in which the id-part is not true and therefore $m$ and $n$ are not isomorphic.	3
784	783	If you have no restrictions on m and n, then clearly they cannot be isomorphisms in general.  For instance, take any two groups G and H and let m: G --> H, n: H --> G be the zero homomorphisms.Even if you say that n and m are monomorphisms, then it is still not true in general that they are isomorphisms.  I believe it is true however if your category is one whose objects are sets with additional structure. See this question: If $A$ is a subobject of $B$, and $B$ a subobject of $A$, are they isomorphic?.	7
785	Is there a general formula for solving 4th degree equations (quartic)?	There is a general formula for solving quadratic equations, namely the Quadratic Formula.For third degree equations of the form $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0$, there is a set of thee equations: one for each root.Is there a general formula for solving equations of the form$ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e=0$?How about for higher degrees? If not, why not?	89
786	785	There is, in fact, a general formula for solving quartic (4th degree polynomial) equations.  As the cubic formula is significantly more complex than the quadratic formula, the quartic formula is significantly more complex than the cubic formula.  Wikipedia's article on quartic functions has a lengthy process by which to get the solutions, but does not give an explicit formula.Beware that in the cubic and quartic formulas, depending on how the formula is expressed, the correctness of the answers likely depends on a particular choice of definition of principal roots for nonreal complex numbers and there are two different ways to define such a principal root.There cannot be explicit algebraic formulas for the general solutions to higher-degree polynomials, but proving this requires mathematics beyond precalculus (it is typically proved with Galois Theory now, though it was originally proved with other methods).  This fact is known as the Abel-Ruffini theorem.Also of note, Wolfram sells a poster that discusses the solvability of polynomial equations, focusing particularly on techniques to solve a quintic (5th degree polynomial) equation.  This poster gives explicit formulas for the solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations.edit:  I believe that the formula given below gives the correct solutions for x to $ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+d+e=0$ for all complex a, b, c, d, and e, under the assumption that $w=\sqrt{z}$ is the complex number such that $w^2=z$ and $\arg(w)\in(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$ and $w=\sqrt[3]{z}$ is the complex number such that $w^3=z$ and $\arg(w)\in(-\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{\pi}{3}]$ (these are typically how computer algebra systems and calculators define the principal roots).  Some intermediate parameters $p_k$ are defined to keep the formula simple and to help in keeping the choices of roots consistent.Let: \begin{align*}p_1&=2c^3-9bcd+27ad^2+27b^2e-72ace\\\\p_2&=p_1+\sqrt{-4(c^2-3bd+12ae)^3+p_1^2}\\\\p_3&=\frac{c^2-3bd+12ae}{3a\sqrt[3]{\frac{p_2}{2}}}+\frac{\sqrt[3]{\frac{p_2}{2}}}{3a}\end{align*}$\quad\quad\quad\quad$\begin{align*}p_4&=\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2}-\frac{2c}{3a}+p_3}\\\\p_5&=\frac{b^2}{2a^2}-\frac{4c}{3a}-p_3\\\\p_6&=\frac{-\frac{b^3}{a^3}+\frac{4bc}{a^2}-\frac{8d}{a}}{4p_4}\end{align*}Then: $$\begin{align}x&=-\frac{b}{4a}-\frac{p_4}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{p_5-p_6}}{2}\\\\\mathrm{or\ }x&=-\frac{b}{4a}-\frac{p_4}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{p_5-p_6}}{2}\\\\\mathrm{or\ }x&=-\frac{b}{4a}+\frac{p_4}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{p_5+p_6}}{2}\\\\\mathrm{or\ }x&=-\frac{b}{4a}+\frac{p_4}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{p_5+p_6}}{2}\end{align}$$(These came from having Mathematica explicitly solve the quartic, then seeing what common bits could be pulled from the horrifically-messy formula into parameters to make it readable/useable.)	87
787	785	Yes, there is a quartic formula.There is no such solution by radicals for higher degrees. This is a result of Galois theory, and follows from the fact that the symmetric group $S_5$ is not solvable. It is called Abel's theorem. In fact, there are specific fifth-degree polynomials whose roots cannot be obtained by using radicals from $\mathbb{Q}$.	11
788	Why is it so hard to find the roots of polynomial equations?	The question that follows was inspired by this question:When trying to solve for the roots of a polynomial equation, the quadratic formula is much more simple than the cubic formula and the cubic formula is much more simple than the quartic formula. That the general solutions to various polynomial equations are so complex and difficult to derive seems to suggest a fundamental limitation in the problem solving capabilities of the mathematical machinery. Does this intuition of mine make any sense? What should I make of it?Why is it that with each successive degree in a polynomial equation, the solution becomes so much more complex? Can I gain some intuition about what makes finding the roots so hard?According to the Abel-Ruffini theorem: "there is no general algebraic solution—that is, solution in radicals— to polynomial equations of degree five or higher." What is so special about the quintic that makes it the cut-off for finding a general algebraic solution?	30
789	707	First, sticking to strings of length n=2:$P(10)=p_i (1-p_i)=\frac{i}{m+1}\left (1-\frac{i}{m+1}  \right )=\frac{i(m+1-i)}{(m+1)^2}$ and $P(11)=p_i^2=\left (\frac{i}{m+1}  \right )^2=\frac{i^2}{(m+1)^2}$; $E(p_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_iP(p_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{i}{m+1}\left(\frac{P(10)+P(11)}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(P(10)+P(11))} \right )$ $=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{i}{m+1}\left(\frac{i(m+1-i)}{(m+1)^2}+\frac{i^2}{(m+1)^2} \right )}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(\frac{i(m+1-i)}{(m+1)^2}+\frac{i^2}{(m+1)^2} \right )}$ $=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{i}{m+1}\left(i(m+1-i)+i^2\right )}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(i(m+1-i)+i^2\right )}$ $=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}i^2}{(m+1)\sum_{i=1}^{m}i}$ $=\frac{\left(\frac{m(m+1)(2m+1)}{6} \right )}{(m+1)\frac{m(m+1)}{2}}$ $=\frac{2m+1}{3(m+1)}$; $\lim_{m\to\infty}E(p_i)=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{2m+1}{3(m+1)}=\frac{2}{3}$For general n:$P(1...)=p_i\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\left({n-1 \choose k}p_i^k(1-p_i)^{n-1-k} \right )=p_i$ (yes, P(1...) does not depend on n at all!);$E(p_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_iP(p_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_i\left(\frac{P(1...)}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}P(1...)} \right )=\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_i\left(\frac{p_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_i} \right )$ $=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_i}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(\frac{i}{m+1} \right )^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{i}{m+1}}$ $=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}i^2}{(m+1)\sum_{i=1}^{m}i}=\frac{2m+1}{3(m+1)}$ (no surprise there, given that $P(1...)$ doesn't depend on n);$\lim_{m\to\infty}E(p_i)=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{2m+1}{3(m+1)}=\frac{2}{3}$	2
790	Volume of the sphere in a Banach space	For $n > 1$ an integer, there are well-known formulas for volume of the balls.What is the analogous statement in a Banach space/Hilbert Space?	2
791	How to compute the volume of this object via integration?	What is the volume of intersection of the three cylinders with axes of length $1$ in $x, y, z$ directions starting from the origin, and with radius $1$?	6
792	788	When you try to solve a degree $n$ equation, there are $n$ roots you have to find (in principle) and none of them is favoured over any of the others, which (in some metaphorical sense) means that you have to break an $n$-fold symmetry in order to write down the roots.Now the symmetry group of the n roots becomes more and more complicated the larger $n$ is.For $n = 2$, it is abelian (and very small!); for $n = 3$ and $4$ it is still solvable (in the technical sense of group theory), which explains the existence of an explicit formula involving radicals (this is due to Galois, and is a part of so-called Galois theory); for $n = 5$ or more this group is non-solvable (in the technical sense of group theory), and this corresponds to the fact that there is no explicit formula involving radicals.Summary: The complexity of the symmetry group of the $n$ roots leads to a corresponding complexity in explicitly solving the equation.	34
793	Exponential and log functions compose to identity	How to prove that the exponential function and the logarithm function are the inverses of each other? I want it the following way. We must use the definition as power series, and must verify that all the terms of the composition except the coefficent of $z$ vanish, and that the first degree term is $1$.I can write down the proof for the coefficient of $x^n$ for arbitrary but fixed $n$ by explicit verification. But how to settle this for all $n$ at one go?	4
794	462	I don't think the people working in higher-order theorem proving really care about Henkin semantics or models in general, they mostly work with their proof calculi. As long as there are no contradictions or other counterintuitive theorems they are happy. The most important and most difficult theorem they prove is usually that their proof terms terminate, which IIRC can be viewed as a form of soundness.Henkin semantics is most interesting for people trying to extend their first-order methods to higher-order logic, because it behaves essentially like models of first-order logic. Henkin semantics is somewhat weaker than what you would get with standard set-theoretic semantics, which by Gödels incompleteness theorem can't have a complete proof calculus. I think type theories should lie somewhere in between Henkin and standard semantics.  Where does typed lambda calculus come into proof verification?To prove some implication P(x) --> Q(x) with some free variables x you need to map any proof of P(x) to a proof of Q(x). Syntactically a map (a function) can be represented as a lambda term.  Are there any other approaches than higher order logic to proof verification?You can also verify proofs in first-order or any other logic, but then you would loose much of the power of the logic. First-order logic is mostly interesting because it is possible to automatically find proofs, if they are not too complicated. The same applies even more to propositional logic.  What are the limitations/shortcomings of existing proof verification systems (see below)?The more powerful the logic becomes the harder it becomes to construct proofs.Since the systems are freely available I suggest you play with them, e.g. Isabelle and Coq for a start.	3
795	How to prove that a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to sum to any real number?	There is a  theorem of Riemann to that effect. How to prove it?Note: This was asked by Kenny in the beta for "calculus".	4
797	What's so "natural" about the base of natural logarithms?	There are so many available bases. Why is the strange number $e$ preferred over all else?Of course one could integrate $\frac{1}x$ and see this. But is there more to the story?	70
799	Why does the discriminant of an integral polynomial have integral coefficients?	Ok, Ok, I know that in fact the discriminant is defined (up to sign) as a product of differences of the roots of the polynomial.But why does it then have integral coefficients, if the polynomial you started with had integer coefficients?	3
800	797	Differentiation and integration is precisely why it is considered natural, but not just because $$\displaystyle\int \frac{1}{x} dx=\ln x$$$e^x$ has the two following nice properties$$ \frac{d}{dx} e^x=e^x $$$$ \int e^x dx=e^x+c $$If we looked at $a^x$ instead, we would get:$$\frac {d} {dx} a^x= \frac{d}{dx} e^{x\ln(a)}=\ln(a) \cdot a^x$$$$\int a^x dx= \int e^{x\ln(a)} dx=\frac{a^x}{\ln(a)}+c$$So $e$ is vital to the integration and differentiation of exponentials.	48
801	797	The Wikipedia article about e lists many properties of the constant that make it naturally occurring.I think the biggest reason it is natural when it comes to exponentiation/logarithms is that it is the only number that satisfies $$ \frac{d}{dt} e^t =e^t $$ while every other number satisfies $$ \frac{d}{dt} a^t = c \cdot a^t$$ where $c$ is some constant, different than 1.  This makes it "normalized" in a sense.	11
805	797	The wikipedia article on e tells a bit of the story.  One example is an account that starts with 1.00 and pays 100% interest per year. If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value is 2.00; but if the interest is computed and added twice in the year, the 1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding 1.00×1.5² = $2.25. Compounding quarterly yields 1.00×1.254 = 2.4414…, and compounding monthly yields 1.00×(1.0833…)12 = 2.613035….  Bernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the force of interest) for more and smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly yields 2.692597…, while compounding daily yields 2.714567…, just two cents more. Using n as the number of compounding intervals, with interest of 100%/n in each interval, the limit for large n is the number that came to be known as e; with continuous compounding, the account value will reach 2.7182818…. More generally, an account that starts at $1, and yields (1+R) dollars at simple interest, will yield eR dollars with continuous compounding.Additionally, it is the base of the exponential function y = k^x, finding a specific value for k where d/dx k^x = k^x.  That is, the rate of change of the exponential curve at any point is equal to the y value of the curve at that point.	22
806	Applications of class number	There is the notion of class number from algebraic number theory. Why is such a notion defined and what good comes out of it?It is nice if it is $1$; we have unique factorization of all ideals; but otherwise?	9
807	799	The square of the discriminant is symmetric in the roots of the polynomial; if you permute the roots, it stays the same.  By the fundamental theorem of symmetric functions, that means it can be expressed as a polynomial, with integer coefficients, in the coefficients of the original polynomial.  (I am using both "coefficients" and "polynomial" in two senses here, so let me know if this doesn't make sense.)  This is a basic observation which will become important if you ever study Galois theory.An example will probably make this clearer.  Suppose I have a quadratic polynomial $x^2 + bx + c$ with two roots $r_1, r_2$.  Then $x^2 + bx + c = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, so $b = - r_1 - r_2$ and $c = r_1 r_2$.  These are the elementary symmetric functions in two variables, and the theorem above implies that every polynomial function of $r_1$ and $r_2$ which is invariant under switching the two is actually a polynomial in $b$ and $c$.  For example, the discriminant is$$(r_1 - r_2)^2 = r_1^2 - 2r_1 r_2 + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1 r_2 = b^2 - 4c.$$	9
808	795	Let the number be r.  The idea is that you first add all the positive elements of the sequence in order, until you get over r, then you add all the negative elements until you get under r, and then all the positive until you get over r, and so forth.	7
809	798	Obviously this depends on the shape, as you implied. I would say for a circle the circumference formula is simpler. Also the length of the curve is a volume in some sense, its just 1 dimensional. Usually in calculus we are calculating the area relative to the the x-axis, and your formula is in terms of $x$, so that makes things simpler. I imagine that if the curve was parameterized in terms of its arc length finding its length would be quite trivial, and finding the area between the curve and the x-axis would seem very complicated.	0
811	803	The proof that uses the fact that shearing a parallelogram parallel to one of its sides preserves area is my favorite.  Here's an animation from this site:	39
812	798	The length of a curve doesn't transform in a nice way under scaling of one of the variables the same way that the area of a 2d figure or the volume of a 3d figure does.  That puts a hard lower bound on how complicated it has to be.	5
813	793	There is a combinatorial proof.  If $A(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} a_n \frac{x^n}{n!}$ is an exponential generating function for the number of ways $a_n$ to put a certain structure on a set of size $n$, where $a_0 = 0$, then $\exp A(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} b_n \frac{x^n}{n!}$ has coefficients $b_n$ which count the number of ways to split a set of size $n$ into subsets, each of which is given an $A$-structure.  For example, $A(x) = e^x - 1$ is the structure of "being a nonempty set," and $\exp A(x)$ counts the number of ways to partition a set into nonempty subsets.Now $\log \frac{1}{1 - x} = \sum_{n \ge 1} \frac{x^n}{n}$ can be thought of as the structure of "being a cycle," which is to say there are $(n-1)!$ ways to arrange $n$ objects into a cycle $s_1 \to s_2 \to ... \to s_n \to s_1$.  So $\exp \log \frac{1}{1 - x}$ counts the number of ways to split $n$ objects up into disjoint cycles, which is the same as the number of permutations of $n$ by cycle decomposition.  So$$\exp \log \frac{1}{1 - x} = \frac{1}{1 - x}.$$A generalization of this argument lets you compute the cycle index polynomials of the symmetric groups.  Note that all of the above manipulations take place in the ring of formal power series over $\mathbb{Z}$.	8
814	804	A nice application is Wedderburn's theorem: every finite skewfield is necessarily commutative. Here a skewfield is something which satisfies the same axioms as field, except that multiplication is not required to be commutative; the typical example are quaternions.To see this, let $F$ be a finite skewfield, $Z$ be its center. It is easy to see that $Z$ is a field, hence it must be $\mathbb{F}_q$ for some prime power $q = p^k$. $F$ will then be a vector space of finite dimension $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, hence it will have $q^n$ elements.Now write the class equation for the multiplicative group of $F$:$$q^n - 1 = q - 1 + \sum_i \frac{q^n - 1}{q^{t_i} - 1}$$Here $q - 1$ appears as the cardinality of the center, while the sum extends over a set of representatives of the non-trivial conjugacy classes.Note that for $q^{t_i} - 1$ to divide $q^n - 1$, $t_i$ must divide $n$. Indeed the order of $q$ modulo $q^{t_i} - 1$ is $t_i$, and $q^n = 1 \pmod{q^{t_i} - 1}$.Now let $f_n$ be the $n$-th cyclotomic polynomial. Then $f_n(q)$ divides $q^n - 1$ and it also divides each term in the sum, so $f_n(q)$ divides $q - 1$.But this is impossible unless $n = 1$ and the sum is empty, in which case $F$ is commutative. Indeed $f_n(q)$ is a product of terms of the form $q - \omega$, where $\omega$ is a root of unity, and this product will have bigger absolute value than $q - 1$ as soon as $n > 1$.	8
816	740	The Cauchy distribution is another example.  This distribution pops up frequently in statistical reasoning.  For example, the ratio of two independent standard normal random variables is a standard Cauchy variable.  We calculate ratios all the time, but often forget to consider that their distribution does not follow a simple normal distribution.This is interesting for several reasons:The mean and variance for the Cauchy distribution are undefined (--> infinity).  If one is trying to estimate these parameters for the ratio of two normal variables, the results may blow up to rather large values that are hard to interpret.In such a situation, one would therefore prefer to use more robust estimators of the central tendency (such as the median) and scale (median absolute deviation).  When designing and testing robust estimators (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics), one way to test them is to try them out on a Cauchy distribution, and make sure that they don't blow up like the usual formulas for mean and variance.	2
817	797	If you know some linear algebra, then here is an abstract reason: $e^x$ is the unique eigenvector of eigenvalue $1$ of the derivative $D$ acting on, say, the space of smooth functions on $\mathbb{R}$.  Why is this important?  The study of solutions of linear differential equations with constant coefficients is equivalent to the study of nullspaces of operators which are polynomials in $D$, e.g. operators of the form $\sum a_k D^k$.  Any such operator automatically commutes with $D$, so this nullspace splits up into eigenspaces of $D$.  That's why solutions to linear differential equations with constant coefficients can be expressed as sums of complex exponentials.  The choice of $e$ makes it particularly easy to see what the eigenvalue is: the eigenvalue of the eigenvector $e^{\lambda x}$ is $\lambda$.	33
818	806	We say that a prime p is regular if it does not divide the class number of the p-th cyclotomic field. For regular primes, it is easy to prove Fermat's last theorem, as outlined for instance in Milne's notes.Basically, everything would be easy if the class number was 1, in which case one could use unique factorization. If the class number is prime to p, you use the fact that every ideal whose p-th power is principal must itself be principal. This, together with unique factorization for ideals, turns out to be all that you need in the naif proof.	7
819	803	This is not really a proof, in the sense that it depends on certain physical assumptions, but it forces you to think very hard about what those physical assumptions are.  I learned it from Mark Levi's The Mathematical Mechanic, although unfortunately I don't have a diagram.Consider a fish tank in the shape of a triangular prism, where the triangle on top has vertices $A, B, C$ ($C$ is the right angle) and the triangle on the bottom has opposite vertices $A', B', C'$.  Let $a, b, c$ denote the lengths of the opposite sides.  Run a rod through the edge $A A'$ on which the fish tank is allowed to pivot, and fill it with water.  By conservation of energy, this system is in mechanical equilibrium.  On the other hand, I claim (and it is not hard to see) that the total torque about the rod is proportional to $c^2 - b^2 - a^2$, each contribution coming from the pressure of the water in the tank against the corresponding side.	11
820	640	As Akhil mentions, the keyword is elliptic regularity.  Since I don't know anything about this, let me just say some low-level things and maybe they'll make sense to you.A differentiable function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ can be thought of as a function which behaves locally like a linear function $f(x) = ax + b$.  So, very roughly, it is a collection of tiny vectors which fit together.  These tiny vectors can, however, fit together in a very erratic manner.  That's because since you only have to fit one vector to the two vectors that are its neighbors, there is a lot of room for bad behavior.A differentiable function $f : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ has to satisfy a much more stringent requirement: locally, it has to behave like a linear function $f(z) = az + b$ where $z, a, b$ are complex, which is a rotation (and scale, and translation).  So, very roughly, it is a collection of tiny rotations which fit together.  Now one rotation has a continuum of neighbors to worry about, and it becomes much harder for erratic behavior to persist.	77
821	799	Another definition of discriminant is as the resultant of the polynomial with it's first derivative (up to a scalar), and the resultant of two polynomials vanishes if and only if they have a common root.  So when does a polynomial have a common root with it's derivative? That's when a zero is also a local max or min, precisely a multiple root.	3
822	785	Regarding the inability to solve the quintic, this is sort-of true and sort-of false.  No, there is no general solution in terms of $+$, $-$, $\times$ and $\div$, along with $\sqrt[n]{}$.  However, if you allow special theta values (a new operation, not among the standard ones!) then yes, you can actually write down the solutions of arbitrary polynomials this way.  Also, you can do construct lengths equal to the solutions by intersecting lower degree curves (for a quintic, you can do so with a trident and a circle.)	8
823	640	The existence of a complex derivative means that locally a function can only rotate and expand.  That is, in the limit, disks are mapped to disks.  This rigidity is what makes a complex differentiable function infinitely differentiable, and even more, analytic.For a complex derivative to exist, it has to exist and have the same value for all ways the "h" term can go to zero in $\frac {(f(z+h) - f(z))}{h}$.  In particular, h could approach 0 along any radial path, and that's why an analytic function must map disks to disks in the limits.  By contrast, an infinitely differentiable function of two real variables could map a disk to an ellipse, stretching more in one direction than another.  An analytic function can't do that.  A smooth function of two variables could also flip a disk over, such as $f(x, y) = (x, -y)$.  An analytic function can't do that either.  That's why complex conjugation is not an analytic function.  	53
824	790	Maybe this is helpful, a formula for the volume of Lp balls in R^n.	4
825	600	I wrote a series of blog posts which explains how to solve questions like this; the relevant one is here.  The generating function you want is$$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{d | n} (x_1^{n/d} + ... + x_k^{n/d})^d \varphi \left( \frac{n}{d} \right)$$where the coefficient of $x_1^{r_1} ... x_k^{r_k}$ is the number you want.	12
827	815	Isaac NewtonI'm not going to give a complete biography, but for those who don't know...He single-handedly discovered The Calculus. Of course while at the same time, Leibniz "single-handedly" discovered it too. :)He theorized the connection between an object's tendency to fall to the earth and the motion of the heavenly bodies.Studied the laws of motion and developed formulas we commonly use todayInvestigated light refractionCalculated the speed of sound to less than 1% the experimented valueHe used the "dot notation" to signify time derivatives, which I prefer far over prime notation. :)	11
828	535	Well, you're looking at $p_c(x) = 4x^4 + 8x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + c=0$, which is just $c=-4x^4-8x^3+3x^2+9x$, so if you graph in the $xc$-plane, you'll get a quartic that opens down with the horizontal cross sections the zeros for given $c$.  In fact, because we can solve for $c$ like this to make it a graph in the affine plane, it is a rational quartic curve, so you might want to start looking there.	1
829	756	Falagar's answer doesn't seem to be for this question. In this question we only can ask higher/lower, not questions about arbitrary bits. I would think only checking if he lied after a certain number of questions would be best. When playing the game, if he lied at one point, you'd start to get all the answers being either higher or lower (because you're searching in the wrong area) So the point is to maximize the number of times he must change his answer to be able to detect his lie more easily. So I think it would skew your guesses to either the upper or lower end of range. [Sorry for this long post, I can't comment yet and I didn't want to just say people aren't reading the question correctly]	-1
830	575	Answer edited, in response to the comment and a second wind for explaining mathematics:Let $F(x_0,x_1,x_2)=0$ be the equation for your curve, and take $(y_0,y_1,y_2)$ to be coordinates on $(\mathbb{P}^2)^*$.  Also, assume that $F$ is irreducible and has no linear factors.Then $y_0 x_0+y_1 x_1+y_2 x_2=0$ is the equation of a general line in $\mathbb{P}^2$ (recall, here $y_0,y_1,y_2$ are fixed, and the $x_i$ are the coordinates on the plane) and we look at the open set of $(\mathbb{P}^2)^*$ where $y_2\neq 0$.  On this open set, we can solve the equation of the line for $x_2$, and look at $g(x_0,x_1)=y_2^n F(x_0,x_1,-\frac{1}{y_2}(y_0x_0+y_1x_1))$, a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ in $x_0,x_1$ with coefficients homogeneous polynomials in the $y_i$.  This polynomial has zeros the intersections of our curve $C$ with the line $L$ we're looking at.So we want to find points of multiplicity at least two.  So how do we find multiple roots of a polynomial? We take the discriminant! Specifically, we do it for an affinization, and we get a homogeneous polynomial of degree $2n^2-n$ in the $y_i$.All that's left is to factor the polynomial, and kill all the linear factors, just throw them away, the reasons are explained in more computational detail on my blogpost, and there I also do explicit examples, but the method for calculating the equation of the dual curve is as above.	2

832	540	Suppose you want to put a probability distribution on the natural numbers for the purpose of doing number theory.  What properties might you want such a distribution to have?  Well, if you're doing number theory then you want to think of the prime numbers as acting "independently": knowing that a number is divisible by $p$ should give you no information about whether it's divisible by $q$.That quickly leads you to the following realization: you should choose the exponent of each prime in the prime factorization independently.  So how should you choose these?  It turns out that the probability distribution on the non-negative integers with maximum entropy and a given mean is a geometric distribution, as explained for example by Keith Conrad here.  So let's take the probability that the exponent of $p$ is $k$ to be equal to $(1 - r_p) r_p^k$ for some constant $r_p$.This gives the probability that a positive integer $n = p_1^{e_1} ... p_k^{e_k}$ occurs as$\displaystyle C \prod_{i=1}^{k} r_p^{e_i}$where $C = \prod_p (1 - r_p)$.  So we need to choose $r_p$ such that this product converges.  Now, we'd like the probability that $n$ occurs to be monotonically decreasing as a function of $n$.  It turns out (and this is a nice exercise) that this is true if and only if $r_p = p^{-s}$ for some $s > 1$ (since $C$ has to converge), which gives the probability that $n$ occurs as$\frac{ \frac{1}{n^s} }{ \zeta(s)}$where $\zeta(s)$ is the zeta function.  One way of thinking about this argument is that $\zeta(s)$ is the partition function of a statistical-mechanical system called the Riemann gas.  As $s$ gets closer to $1$, the temperature of this system increases until it would require infinite energy to make $s$ equal to $1$.  But this limit is extremely important to understand: it is the limit in which the probability distribution above gets closer and closer to uniform.  So it's not surprising that you can deduce statistical information about the primes by studying the behavior as $s \to 1$ of this distribution.Let me mention two other reasons to care about the limit as $s \to 1$ of the above distribution.  First, the basic reason to think of the primes as acting independently is the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  Second, a natural reason to look at a distribution where the probability that a number has exactly $k$ factors of $p$ is $(1 - p^{-1}) p^{-k}$ is that this is precisely the distribution you get on the residues $\bmod p^n$ for $k < n$.  In fact, I believe this can be upgraded to the corresponding statement about Haar measure on the $p$-adic integers.  	77
833	519	Your group is the alternating subgroup of a Coxeter group$$\langle x, y, z | x^2 = y^2 = z^2 = (xy)^2 = (yz)^3 = (zx)^7 = 1 \rangle$$which is not on the (well-understood) list of finite Coxeter groups, and the alternating subgroup always has index $2$.  (The connection to the hyperbolic plane is that Coxeter groups of rank $3$ always act as symmetries of a tiling of either the sphere, the Euclidean plane, or the hyperbolic plane by triangles.)	1

836	806	Well, class field theory states that the class number is the degree of the largest everywhere-unramified abelian extension of a number field (namely, the Hilbert class field).  But class field theory really says a lot more: it says that there's an isomorphism between the Galois group and the ideal class group. And in general, for any abelian extension $L/K$, there's an isomorphism between $G(L/K)$ and a certain "generalized ideal class group" of $K$ where you quotient by ideals that are norms from $L$.  This can be stated somewhat more elegantly using ideles.But, you asked about the class number. In class field theory, it's difficult (to my knowledge) to prove directly that the Artin reciprocity map defined from ideals to the Galois group is an isomorphism. You can show that it is surjective and injective, however; to do this, you have to estimate the order of these generalized ideal class groups, which you can do using either analytic (L-function) methods or algebraic (e.g., using the Herbrand quotient) methods. So this is where the size and seemingly "decategorified" properties (like the order) become more important than the groups themselves: the proofs.	8
837	250	The rational numbers are both a continuum (between any two rationals you can find another rational) and countable (they can be lined up in correspondence with the positive integers).Mathematician missed it for hundreds (thousands?) of years, until Cantor.Of course, the proof of that works both ways, and is equally surprising the other way -- there is a way to order the integers (or any countable set) that makes it into a continuum.	12
838	640	On an intuition level:Complex numbers are somewhat equivalent to $\mathbb R^2$ (homeomorphic to a $2$-dimensional real space), on the other hand they are also a $1$-dimensional complex space. This gives them an extra structure with consequences like this theorem.Another view on this is that differentiable complex functions must also satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations and this extra hypothesis is what makes them holomorphic.	4
839	835	In maths, the expected value is the average of how much you'd win if you used the same strategy from the same position a large (approaching infinity) number of times. We should first note that expected value alone doesn't decide the best option. We also have to take into account risk. Most people (other than gamblers) would prefer a certain dollar rather than a fifty percent chance of two and fifty percent of nothing. To deal with this, we typically define utility instead. Utility varies between individuals and is determined by their risk profile.Since the dollar amount are quite large for contestants, it would be logical (in theory) to find someone who can afford to take the risk to insure you. This would allow you to receive the gains from a risker strategy. For deal or no deal, they encourage you to play by making their offers worse than the expected value at the start of the game. Later, (according to Wikipedia) the offers may even exceed the expected value. Without knowing how exactly the offers are calculated (or forming a model), we can't answer this question accurately, but only make general statements.If we ignore risk and offers being greater than expected utility, you'd always want to go as far as possible in the game. But, as is, the game is extremely difficult to analyse mathematically.	0
840	250	Suppose you have a large collection of books, all of the same size.  Balance one of them on the edge of a table so that one end of the book is as far from the table as possible.  Balance another book on top of that one, and again try to get as far from the table as possible.  Take $n$ of them and try to balance them on top of each other so that the top book is as far as possible away from the edge of the table horizontally.Theorem:  With enough books, you can get arbitrarily far from the table.  If you are really careful.  This is a consequence of the divergence of the harmonic series.  I think if you haven't heard this one before it's very hard to tell whether it's true or false.	91
842	Why is compactness in logic called compactness?	In logic, a semantics is said to be compact iff if every finite subset of a set of sentences has a model, then so to does the entire set. Most logic texts either don't explain the terminology, or allude to the topological property of compactness. I see an analogy as, given a topological space X and a subset of it S, S is compact iff for every open cover of S, there is a finite subcover of S. But, it doesn't seem strong enough to justify the terminology. Is there more to the choice of the terminology in logic than this analogy?	60
843	841	I'm pretty sure you mean the evaluation of definite integrals. For instance, $e^{-x^2}$ has no elementary antiderivative, but it's definite integral over the real line can be computed explicitly (it's $\sqrt{\pi}$).You ask what complex analysis has to do with this. Well, the idea is that complex integrals around closed curves (of holomorphic functions) are usually comparatively easy to evaluate: it's because we have the residue theorem as a tool.However, these real integrals are usually over the whole real line, which doesn't satisfy the hypothesis of a path under the residue theorem. For instance, it's not a finite closed path.  However, we can replace the real number by a large semicircle (to pick one common example) that goes from $-R$ to $R$, then around the upper-half-plane from $R$ to $-R$. This is a closed path and the residue theorem can apply to this. When you let $R$ to $\infty$, the integral around semicircular path often tends to zero (by direct bounding arguments). So what you're left with is the integral along the real line, and it's equal to the residues.Examples of this will be in any complex analysis textbook, e.g. Ahlfors's.  The Wikipedia article on the residue theorem (link above) also has examples.	5
844	842	This isn't a complete answer, partly because I've had discussions with other grad students and we weren't able to work it out satisfactorily, but I've been told that you can actually put a topology on logical statements such that the compactness theorem translates to "The set of true statements is a compact subset of the set of all statements" or something similar.  But as I said, a few of my friends and I weren't able to work out the topology.	1
845	842	As far as I know, the link comes from the syntactic theory. You are given a set of symbols of sentence F = {f_i} and you are allowed allowed to form complex statements using them. You can combine the elementary statements with AND, OR, NOT operators and parentheses, in the usual way.So you get a set X of composed sentences, like(f AND g) OR (NOT h)or something like that.A syntactic version of the compactness theorem states the following.  Assume that for every finite subset Y of X you can assign truth values to the f_i in such a way that all sentences in Y are true. Than you can do the same for X.Proof  Consider the topological space A obtained by taking the product of {0, 1} over the set F. The topology on A is the product topology. By Tychonoff's theorem, A is compact. For every composed statement s, the set of truth values which make s true is a finite intersection of cylinders, hence it is a closed set of A. The hypothesis say that every finite intersection of such closed sets, for s ranging in X, is not empty. Hence the intersection of all such closed set is not empty, which means one can make all statements in X true.	5
846	842	The analogy for the compactness theorem for propositional calculus is as follows. Let $p_i $ be propositional variables; together, they take values in the product space $2^{\mathbb{N}}$.  Suppose we have a collection of statements $S_t$ in these boolean variables such that every finite subset is satisfiable. Then I claim that we can prove that they are all simultaneously satisfiable by using a compactness argument.Let $F$ be a finite set. Then the set of all truth assignments (this is a subset of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$) which satisfy $S_t$ for $t \in F$ is a closed set $V_F$ of assignments satisfying the sentences in $F$.  The intersection of any finitely many of the $V_F$ is nonempty, so by the finite intersection property, the intersection of all of them is nonempty (since the product space is compact), whence any truth in this intersection satisfies all the statements.I don't know how this works in predicate logic.	11
847	Law of cosines with impossible triangles	Is there any mathematical significance to the fact that the law of cosines...$$\cos(\textrm{angle between }a\textrm{ and }b) = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}$$... for an impossible triangle yields a cosine $< -1$ (when $c > a+b$), or $> 1$ (when $c < \left|a-b\right|$)For example, $a = 3$, $b = 4$, $c = 8$ yields $\cos(\textrm{angle }ab) = -39/24$.Or $a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = 1$ yields $\cos(\textrm{angle }ab) = 33/30$.Something to do with hyperbolic geometry/cosines?	6
848	311	A further sense in which Higher Order Logics with standard or saturated semantics (HOL, hereafter) are less well-behaved than First Order Logic (FOL, hereafter) is a direct consequences of the failure of Completeness (and thus, as explained in other answers, of Compactness). The set of logical truths and the set of correct claims of semantic consequence for these logics are not recursively enumerable.FOL is Complete, yet not Decidable. So, we determine of an arbitrary sentences and sets of sentences of the language of FOL if those sentences are logical truths or if a set has a given sentence as a consequence. But, since FOL is Complete and proofs are finitely long, we can (in the mathematicians sense of "can") enumerate the proofs and inspect one by one, checking what sentence the proof shows as a theorem or what sentence the proof derives from what set of assumptions. This gets us a recursive enumeration of the truths and the sentence/set pairs that stand in the consequence relation. (This does not contradict the failure of decidability as we cannot conclude that since we've yet to come across a proof in out enumeration, there isn't one if only we kept looking.)Since HOL's are not Complete, this means of showing them recursively enumerable is not available. Indeed, there can be no means; were there such a means, it could be exploited to induce a Complete proof system, and there cannot be such a Complete proof system as the HOL's are not Compact. 	1
849	841	A generic real-valued function carries no additional information other than its values.  But many of the common functions encountered in analysis are just the restriction to $\mathbb{R}$ of holomorphic functions, and these functions carry a lot of additional information, namely, their values in $\mathbb{C}$.  Unlike real-analytic functions, holomorphic functions are extremely rigid: for example, if two holomorphic functions agree on a set of complex numbers with a limit point, they must be equal everywhere.  That means it's possible to deduce information about how a holomorphic function behaves on part of its domain (say, $\mathbb{R}$) from information about how it behaves on other parts of its domain, since the two have to determine each other.  This information is extracted using contour integrals.	3
851	847	One can prove the triangle inequality in any abstract inner product space, such as a Hilbert space; it is a consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality $\langle a, b \rangle^2 \le ||a||^2 ||b||^2$.  In order for the triangle inequality to fail, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality has to fail, and in order for Cauchy-Schwarz to fail (which corresponds to the "cosine" no longer being between $1$ and $-1$), some axiom of an abstract inner product space has to be given up.  One choice is to give up positive-definiteness; in other words, lengths of vectors are no longer always non-negative.  This leads to geometries like Minkowski spacetime which are relevant to relativity.  In Minkowski spacetime, there is a reverse triangle inequality instead.Edit:  I should also mention that the "unit sphere" in Minkowski spacetime is a model for hyperbolic geometry called the hyperboloid model.	2
852	847	For some a, b, and c that form a triangle: increasing the length of c increases the measure of angle C and as m∠C approaches 180°, cos C approaches -1; decreasing the length of c increases the measure of angle C and as m∠C approaches 0°, cos C approaches 1.  Extending this pattern, it makes sense that if c > a + b, c has gotten bigger past making a triangle with a and b, so cos C < -1, and if c < |a-b|, c has gotten smaller past making a triangle with a and b, so cos C > 1.In hyperbolic geometry, the definition of lines (and hence triangles) is different and the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is less than 180°.  There is a Hyperbolic Law of Cosines, but it's not quite the same.I don't think there's a sensible way to relate hyperbolic cosine to the Law of Cosines in Euclidean geometry.	0
853	250	Position-based Cryptography. This is a fun example since it seems very "out of left field".The setup:Three servers are positioned in known locations on the globe (their positions can be arbitrary, provided they aren't on top of each other).A single computer wants to prove its location to the servers. In other words, if the computer is actually located where it claims, then the protocol will accept. However, if the computer is located anywhere else, then the protocol will reject, no matter how the computer cheats (it is even allowed to recruit friends to help it cheat).All communication is subject to the laws of physics -- information travels at speed c, and quantum mechanics holds.Theorem 1: This is impossible if all communication is classical. Cheating is always possible.Theorem 2: This is possible if quantum communication is possible.	15
854	250	Goldbach's Conjecture.Granted this is open, so it may be cheating a bit. However, this seems like a very hard problem to intuit your way to the "conventional wisdom". By contrast, P != NP is "obviously" true. Indeed, Feynman had trouble believing P != NP was even open.	9
855	For any prime $p > 3$, why is $p^2-1$ always divisible by 24?	I know this is very basic and old hat to many, but I love this question and I am interested in seeing whether there are any proofs beyond the two I already know.	61
856	855	$P^2-1  = (P+1)(P-1)$. $P$ must be either $1$ or $(2 \mod 3)$, so we have a factor of $3$ in the product. And $P$ is also either $1$ or $3 \mod 4$. Hence either $2|(P+1)$ and $4|(P-1)$ or $2|(P-1)$ and $4|(P+1)$. Thus $8*3= 24$ divides the product.	27
857	855	$p$ must be congruent either to 1,3,5,7 modulo 8.  Then $p^2$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $8$ in either case.  So $8$ divides $p^2-1$.  Now, $p$ is not a multiple of 3, so either $p-1$ or $p+1$ is a multiple of three. So $3$ divides $p^2-1$. Together, it follows that 24 divides $p^2 -1 $.	31
858	742	A similar problem is known in mathematics.  It is called the "Postage-Stamp" problem, and usually asks which postal values can be realized and which cannot.  Dynamic programming is a common but not polynomial-time solution for this.  A polynomial time solution using continued fractions in the case of two stamp denominations exists, and more complex algorithms exist for three or more stamp denominations.  Look up "Frobenius Number" for more technical information.For the given problem, I would roughly estimate the Frobenius number, and based on the estimate make an easy guess as to a near-solution and then use a dynamic programming/tabular solution, depending on the amount of time I had to solve the problem.	1

860	855	The most elementary proof I can think of, without explicitly mentioning any number theory: out of the three consecutive numbers $p – 1$, $p$, $p + 1$, one of them must be divisible by $3$; also, since the neighbours of p are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by $2$ and the other by $4$, so their product is divisible by $3 · 2 · 4 = 24$ — and of course, we can throw $p$ out since it's prime, and those factors cannot come from it.	140
861	Cotangent bundle	This may be a poorly phrased question - please let me know of it - but what is the correct way to think of the cotangent bundle? It seems odd to think of it as the dual of the tangent bundle (I am finding it odd to reconcile the notions of "maps to the ground field" with this object).	7
862	842	A motto which is related (and sometimes true) is "proofs are finite".  In most systems of logic under consideration, the statement and a proof of the statement are finite strings of symbols.  One can think of them as "compactly" represented.  How nice then that certain systems will always allow a proof to be found if there is one.  While this does not give a tight connection to topology, it suggests (and you need to work this through on your own to be convinced) that certain infinite abnormalities (like an infinite proof) will not occur.  A similar topological claim is that, for compact sets, an infinite inclusive chain of certain subsets will have nonempty intersection, such a claim easily seen to be false for some non-compact sets, such as the collection { C_n | C_n = {x | x >= n and x is a real number } for n a non-negative integer } .  	8
863	781	As a rough/somewhat-intuitive explanation of why Benford's Law makes sense, consider it with respect to amounts of money.  The amount of time(/effort/work) needed to get from \$1000 to \$2000 (100% increase) is a lot greater than the amount of time needed to get from \$8000 to \$9000 (12.5% increase)--increasing money is usually done in proportion to the money one has.  Thought about in the other direction, it should take a fixed amount of time to, say, double one's money, so going from \$1000 to \$2000 takes as long as from \$2000 to \$4000 and \$4000 to \$8000, so the leading digit spends more time at lower values than at higher values.  Because the value growth is exponential, the time spent at each leading digit is roughly logarithmic.	16
864	842	The Compactness Theorem is equivalent to the compactness of the Stone space of the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra of the first-order language L. (This is also the space of 0-types over the empty theory.)A point in the Stone space SL is a complete theory T in the language L. That is, T is a set of sentences of L which is closed under logical deduction and contains exactly one of σ or ¬σ for every sentence σ of the language. The topology on the set of types has for basis the open sets U(σ) = {T: σ ∈ T} for every sentence σ of L. Note that these are all clopen sets since U(¬σ) is complementary to U(σ).To see how the Compactness Theorem implies the compactness of SL, suppose the basic open sets U(σi), i ∈ I, form a cover of SL. This means that every complete theory T contains at least one of the sentences σi. I claim that this cover has a finite subcover. If not, then the set {¬σi: i ∈ I} is finitely consistent. By the Compactness Theorem, the set consistent and hence (by Zorn's Lemma) is contained in a maximally consistent set T. This theory T is a point of the Stone space which is not contained in any U(σi), which contradicts our hypothesis that the U(σi), i ∈ I, form a cover of the space.To see how the compactness of SL implies the Compactness Theorem, suppose that {σi: i ∈ I} is an inconsistent set of sentences in L. Then U(¬σi), i ∈ I, forms a cover of SL. This cover has a finite subcover, which corresponds to a finite inconsistent subset of {σi: i ∈ I}. Therefore, every inconsistent set has a finite inconsistent subset, which is the contrapositive of the Compactness Theorem.	47
865	861	One fruitful way to think about it, if you have physics background, is as phase space.  Your manifold is the configuration space for some system of particles, and the cotangent bundle is then the phases, so the cotangent directions are velocities.  This is helpful also with the symplectic structure on $T^*M$.	7
866	815	Nicolas BourbakiThe story had me from the moment I realized it is true. And as I come to understand more mathematics, I find that I frequently ask myself "What would Bourbaki do?" Also, the individuals have done much to expose the human side of mathematics.	12
867	795	More generally, if $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} c_n$ is a conditionally convergent series of complex numbers, then the collection of sums of all convergent rearrangements is an affine subspace of the plane $\mathbb{C}$.Here's a sketch of why this is true.Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two rearrangements that converge to the distinct complex numbers $a,b$, respectively. Focus on a partial sum of $A$ that's pretty close to $a$. A sufficiently long partial sum of $B$ will include every term of the former partial sum of $A$, but it will also tend to $b$ as you take more and more terms. It's "clear" then that it's possible to obtain any combination $ta + (1 - t)b$ for $t \in \mathbb{R}$.If in addition there is a point $c$ which is the sum of some rearrangement but is not on the line through $a$ and $b$, then the previous result can be reapplied, replacing the numbers $a$ and $b$ with the numbers $c$ and $d$, where $d$ is any point on the line through $a$ and $b$. It follows that in this case the entire plane $\mathbb{C}$ is obtained by rearranging the original series.	1
868	What is the best way to factor arbitrary polynomials	I am currently working on a Computer Algebra System and was wondering for suggestions on methods of finding roots/factors of polynomials. I am currently using the Numerical Durand-Kerner method but was wondering if there are any good non-numerical methods (primarily for simplifying fractions etc).Ideally this should work for equations in multiple variables.	7
869	861	You might be interested in this MathOverflow post: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/17325/why-is-cotangent-more-canonical-than-tangent(Sorry, I'd leave this as a comment but I just joined this site and don't have enough reputation.)	3
870	868	If you're looking to factor exactly, then you'll need to use something that's not one of the fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and extraction of roots.  The Abel-Ruffini theorem says so for degree five and above.  However, there are numerous other methods to find roots exactly, using more general functions, my favorite being theta functions, as explained in the appendix to Mumford's "Tata Lectures on Theta II"	2
871	392	If you look carefully and geometrically at the quotient limit that defines sin'(x) in the unit circle, and take the chord and tangent as approximations to the arc (that is the angle; this is the essence of sin(x)/x approaches 1), you will see that limit of the derivative quotient tends exactly to cos(x), that is, it's adjacent/hypotenuse. In other words, it's built into right triangle geometry, like so many phenomena in mathematics.Also, in that geometry, you'll see lurking the proof for the sin(x+y) formula, which, along with the limit of sin(x)/x, is how the standard proof that sin'(x) = cos(x) goes.  But skipping that algebra and going directly to the geometry is the most straightforward way I know to answer the question.Sorry I don't have time or tools to draw the pictures.I suspect this saying the same thing as the physics answer above, but perhaps more directly.  I do think all the answers referring to series expansions miss the point.	7
872	What is the relationship between the Hodge dual of p-vectors and the dual space of an ordinary vector space?	I understand what the Hodge dual is, but I can't quite wrap my head around the dual space of vector space. They seem very similar, almost the same, but perhaps they are unrelated. For instance, in R^3, the blade a^b gives you a subspace that's like a plane, and the dual is roughly the normal to the plane.Is there a similarly simple example for the dual space of a vector space, or is there a way to describe the vector space dual in terms of the Hodge dual?	6
873	806	Frequently in studying diophantine equations, or related problems, one is forced to look at rings of integers of algebraic number fields, and it may be that the class number of the ring your are forced to deal with is > 1.  In this case, there is nothing you can do to change that fact; you have to live with it.  As a response, it is natural to try and develop a theory of the class number and the class group, as a means of finding ways to deal with the failure of unique factorization.  Kummer was the one who invented the notion of class number, and he did in the course of his work on Fermat's Last Theorem; this is what is described in Andrea Ferretti's answer, and is an excellent example of what I am talking about.  Another example, quite different in nature, occurs in the proof of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.    This is the theorem that if a and d are coprime natural numbers, then there are infinitely many primes p such that p is congruent to a mod d.  In his proof, he reduces everything to showing that a certain number (the value at 1 of a certain so-called L-function) is non-zero.  He then is able to give a precise formula for this L-function, and shows that it is equal to some non-zero constants times a certain class number.  Since the class number is positive (and so in particular, is non-zero!), he is able to complete his proof.	7
875	574	Generic has different meanings in different branches of geometry.  In algebraic geometry,it usually means that the property in question holds on a Zariski dense open set.  In other geometric contexts, it could also that the property holds on a dense open set (in whatever is the natural topology under consideration), but can also mean that it holds on a countable intersection of such sets.  (The reason for considering such intersections as being big ismotivated by the Baire category theorem, which says that in reasonable contexts the complement of such a set will be very "thin", in some sense.)	7
876	735	Hmm, apparently the other answerers' algebra classes were a lot more intense than mine...My answer's based on what I would have been comfortable with after basic algebra and geometry.Basically, if you think graphically, instantaneous velocity is the slope of a line at a single point rather than over an interval. At least that's what you want. So, if you happen to be going at a constant velocity (any straight line on a position graph), you can just use the slope formula. Where calculus comes in is if you're dealing with an inconstant velocity (a curved line).If that's not making sense right off, just try to realistically graph the movement of a car as it accelerates/decelerates, where the y-axis is position and the x-axis is time.Using algebra, you can't take the slope of a curved line. What you can do is take the slope between two points on the curve. The closer these points get to each other, the closer the slope between them will approximate the actual slope of the curve. So, if the slope between t=5.001 min. and t=5.01 min. is 40, then that approximates the actual slope, and instantaneous velocity, at t=5.0055 min.I don't think I can get much more specific/accurate without going into (pre-)calculus.	4
877	861	I'm not completely sure what you mean by this: "It seems odd to think of it as the dual of the tangent bundle (I am finding it odd to reconcile the notions of "maps to the ground field" with this object)," but maybe the following will help you see why it is natural to consider the dual space of the tangent bundle.Given a function f on our manifold, we want to associate something like the gradient of f.  Well, in calculus, what characterized the gradient of a function?  Its the vector field such that when we take its dot product with a vector v at some point p, we get the directional derivative, at p, of f along v.  In a general manifold we don't have a dot product (which is a metric) but we can form a covector field (something which gives an element of the cotangent bundle at any point) such that, when applied to a vector v, we get the directional derivative of f along v.  This covector field is denoted df and is called the exterior derivative of f.	1
878	574	The term generic usually applies to something which happens in an open dense set of some space. The idea is that open dense sets are large subsets of the space. Indeed, they are closed under finite intersections and thus form a base for a filter of subsets of the space.Sometimes, the term is applied more generally to something which happens in a countable intersection of open dense sets (a dense Gδ set) of some space. Usually, this is in the context of a complete metric space or a locally compact Hausdorff space for which the Baire Category Theorem applies.The generic point is a (sometimes fictitious) point which lies in every open dense set of the space. Irreducible sober spaces always have a generic point, it is the unique point whose closure is the whole space. The only Hausdorff space with a generic point is the one-point space.Fictitious generic points have a variety of uses. Usually one means a point which lies in all open dense sets which are considered in the current argument, without specifying the open dense sets in question. This is fine because the intersection of finitely many (or even countably many in the case of Baire spaces) open dense sets is guaranteed to be nonempty.	10
881	872	(Edit:  I have edited this answer several times because my understanding of the situation has been improving.)It is always profitable to understand these kind of constructions by understanding exactly what information they depend on.  The Hodge dual depends on a surprising amount of information: you need a vector space $V$ which is equipped with both an inner product and an orientation, which is essentially a choice of which bases of $V$ are "right-handed."  So let's see what we can say ignoring all this information first.Any abstract vector space $V$ of finite dimension $n$ has exterior powers $\Lambda^2 V, \Lambda^3 V, ... \Lambda^n V$, the last of which is one-dimensional.  The vector spaces $\Lambda^k V$ and $\Lambda^{n-k} V$ always have the same dimension, so we would like to be able to define some sort of "canonical" map between them.  What can we say?  Well, they are always dual: the wedge product defines a natural bilinear map $\Lambda^k V \times \Lambda^{n-k} V \to \Lambda^n V$, and since the latter is one-dimensional this means (once you've proven nondegeneracy) that the two vector spaces are in fact dual.  But duality does not give you a map between them.  When two vector spaces $V, W$ are dual, meaning there is a nondegenerate bilinear map $V \times W \to F$ (where $F$ is the ground field), all you get is an isomorphism $V \simeq W^{\ast}$.  Here you get an isomorphism $\Lambda^k V \simeq \Lambda^{n-k} V^{\ast}$, once you have specified an isomorphism $\Lambda^n V \simeq F$.  This is equivalent to picking out a distinguished vector in $\Lambda^n V$, which there is no way to do in general.So the answer is to introduce extra data.  To identify $\Lambda^{n-k} V^{\ast}$ with $\Lambda^{n-k} V$, we need an inner product.  An inner product gives you two distinguished vectors in $\Lambda^n V$, as follows: take any orthonormal basis $b_1, ... b_n$.  Then wedging together the $b_i$ in any order gets you one of two elements of $\Lambda^n V$, depending on whether the corresponding permutation is even or odd.  But without any extra data, there is no way to identify one of these elements with $1$ and one of these elements with $-1$.The extra data that does this is an orientation on $V$, which tells you which bases are "right-handed" and which are "left-handed."  So an oriented orthonormal basis gives you a distinguished element of $\Lambda^n V$, which gives you a distinguished isomorphism $\Lambda^k V \simeq \Lambda^{n-k} V^{\ast}$, which composed with the isomorphism $\Lambda^{n-k} V^{\ast} \simeq \Lambda^{n-k} V$ is the Hodge dual.  Phew.This is explained in these notes I just found on Google.	13
882	835	From what I hear about game-shows in general, if your performance does not make it to air, then you don't get anything.  Hence you cannot just accept the first amount offered (if it turns out to be a better choice) and expect to get it, since it won't make an interesting show.	1
886	Deal or no deal: does one switch (to avoid a goat)?/ Should deal or no deal be 10 minutes shorter?	Okay so this question reminded me of one my brother asked me a while back about the hit day-time novelty-worn-off-now snoozathon Deal or no deal.For the uninitiated:In playing deal or no deal, the player is presented with one of 22 boxes (randomly selected) each containing different sums of money, he then asks in turn for each of the 21 remaining boxes to be opened, occasionally receiving an offer (from a wholly unconvincing 'banker' figure) for the mystery amount in his box.If he rejects all of the offers along the way, the player is allowed to work his way through several (for some unfathomable reason, emotionally charged) box openings until there remain only two unopened boxes: one of which is his own, the other not. He is then given a choice to stick or switch (take the contents of his own box or the other), something he then agonises pointlessly over for the next 10 minutes.Monty hall[If you have not seen the monty hall 'paradox' check out this wikipedia link and prepare to be baffled, then enlightened, then disappointed that the whole thing is so trivial. After which feel free to read on.]There is a certain similarity, you will agree, between the situation a deal or no deal player finds himself in having rejected all offers and the dilemma of Monty's contestant in the classic problem: several 'bad choices' have been eliminated and he is left with a choice between a better and worse choice with no way of knowing between them.So???  Question: The solution to the monty hall problem is that it is, in fact, better to switch- does the same apply here? Does this depend upon the money in the boxes? Should every player opt for 'switch', cutting the 10 minutes of agonising away???	5
887	22	Here's an explanation in terms of the Hodge dual and the exterior (wedge) product.Let ${e_1, e_2, e_3}$ be the standard orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$. Consider the two vectors $a = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + a_3 e_3$ and $b = b_1 e_1 + b_2 e_2 + b_3 e_3$. From the matrix computation we obtain the familiar formula$a\times b = (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) e_1 + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) e_2 + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) e_3$.But (see note at the bottom)$a \wedge b = (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) e_1 \wedge e_2 + (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) e_2 \wedge e_3 + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) e_3 \wedge e_1$,where the wedge $\wedge$ represents the exterior product. One can now compute the dual of this latter expression using that the left contraction of $(e_1 \wedge e_2)$ onto $(e_3 \wedge e_2 \wedge e_1)$ is $e_3$ (and similar relations). The result is that$a \times b = (a \wedge b)^*$,that is, the cross product of $a$ and $b$ is the dual of their exterior product.Geometrically, this is an incredible picture. The exterior product is the plane element spanned by both $a$ and $b$, and the dual is the vector orthogonal to that plane.This is my favorite interpretation of the cross product, but it's only helpful, of course, if you're familiar with exterior algebra and the Hodge dual.Note: The wedge product can be found by formally computing $(a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + a_3 e_3) \wedge (b_1 e_1 + b_2 e_2 + b_3 e_3)$using the distributivity and anticommutation relations of the exterior product.	6
888	886	  I would ceratinly plump for saying they were opened at randomThen no, the Monty Hall solution doesn't apply.  The whole point is that the door isn't randomly opened, it's always a goat.An easy way of seeing this is imagining there are 100 doors, with 99 goats.  If, after you pick a door, the host always opens 98 doors of goats, then switching is very intuitively favorable.  However, if he had just opened 98 doors at random, then most of the time (98 out of 100) he would open the door with the car behind it; and even on the rare occasions he didn't, you still wouldn't be any better off switching than staying.See also this answer, in which I try to intuitively explain probability fallacies.	9
889	874	If it is just $45$ degrees, then the answer is not very difficult. Center a coordinate system at the bottom left hand corner of the rectangle. Hence the coordinates of the (???) point are $(q,0)$ for some $q<w$.Note that the because theta is $45$ degrees, $y=w-q$ (Isosceles right triangle). Hence $q=w-y$, and our point is simply $(w-y, 0)\dots$	1

891	886	This doesn't have the key features of the Monty Hall problem:The contestant makes a choiceThe contestant is given information about other choices they could have madeThe contestant can change their choice based on this new informationWithout being given extra information, their is no point in changing your choice.	3
892	Projective plane and its dual	So the projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$ is not a vector space.  Is it still isomorphic to its dual?  If not, is there at least an invertible map that takes $\mathbb{RP}^2$ to its dual?	2
893	892	Yes, though the word "dual" is somewhat questionable.  If you mean is $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, the standard projective plane, isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}((\mathbb{R}^3)^*)$, the projectivization of the dual, then yes, it follows from the isomorphism of vector spaces.Much more interestingly, the duality allows you to switch points and lines in theorems, such as the Mystic Hexagon and Brianchon's Theorem.	3
894	Why is the "finitely many" quantifier not definable in First Order Logic?	In First Order Logic with Identity (FOL+I), one can express the proposition that there are exactly 3 items that have the property P. Why is it not possible to express the proposition that there is a finite number of items that have the property P (in FOL+I)?	7
895	894	Any property expressible under first-order logic is closed under ultraproducts. The property of finite sets is not, however, closed under ultraproducts.	13
896	894	Well, it would mean that you have the statement $P_1\vee P_2\vee\ldots$ where $P_i$ stands for "there are $i$ objects with property $P$", and infinite disjunctions aren't allowed.  As for proving that this isn't equivalent to anything else you can write that IS allowed, I don't know how to do that.	-1
897	835	There are (at least) two factors that mean that simply calculating the average of the remaining options is not enough to describe how someone should play.Risk aversion Someone's utility is not a predictable function of the amount of money that they win. For instance my utility from winning $\$$5 is more than 100 times my utility from winning 5 cents. However, my utility from winning $\$$100 million is less than 100 times my utility from winning $\$$1 million.	3
898	892	This is a comment more than an answer, mainly in response to Qiaochu's question, but I don't have sufficient rep. to comment.The dual to a projective plane is the set of all lines in the plane, which itself is aprojective plane (as hinted at in Charles Siegel's answer).  This is an important concept in classical projective geometry.  (Concretely, the equation for a line has the forma x + b y + c z = 0, where a,b, and c are some parameters, not all zero, and x,y,z are homogeneous coords. for the points in the proj. plane.  The set of all such lines can thusbe thought of as the set of all (a,b,c) not all zero; but note that simultaneously multiplying a, b, and c by a non-zero scalar doesn't change the solution set, i.e. doesn't change the line, so the line should really be thought of as corresponding to the homogeneous coordinates (a:b:c); thus the set of all lines is again a projective plane.)	2
899	154	In my opinion, the most natural way to view complex number is as a class of maps from the plane to itself. Specifically, lets define $(R, \theta)$ to be the map which multiplies every point in the plane by the number $R$, and then rotates it by the angle $\theta$. We may call these maps "dilations with rotations."Such maps can be added and composed (multiplied) in the obvious way, and its not hard to work out that the sum and product of two such mappings is another dilation with rotation.We can also identify the real number $x$ with the map $(x,0)$, i.e. the map which multiplies every point in the plane by $x$.  Then we see that these maps have the magical property that $-1$ has a square root! Namely, if $P$ is the mapping $(1,\pi/2)$ (i.e. rotate every point by angle $\pi/2$), then applying $P$ twice is the same as multiplying every number by $-1$, i.e. $P^2=-1$! As should be obvious by now, these maps are just complex numbers in disguise. Unsurprisingly, they are singularly useful for solving polynomial equations. Indeed, the real number $x'$ is a root of the polynomial equations $a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n =0$ if and only if the mapping $(x',0)$ satisfies the same equation. So viewing polynomial equations over the set of these mappings loses no solutions, while at the same time giving us additional freedom to do operations such as taking the square roots of negative numbers. 	58
900	667	What you are referring to is the "stacks as sheaves of groupoids" point of view. To illustrate where it comes from, imagine for example that we are talking about the moduli stack of elliptic curves (on the category of schemes).  To give an elliptic curve over a scheme, it is not just enough to specify the elliptic curve over the members of the open cover; we have to explain how we glue the restrictions of the curves on the various opens on their overlaps, and this gluing has to be coherent over triple overlaps.  The reason for this is that elliptic curves can have non-trivial automorphisms, so that there is no a priori determined way to make the identifications on the overlaps (because having non-trivial automorphisms is the same as saying that when two curves are isomorphic, they can be isomorphic in more than one way), so it is your job to choose these identifications, and to make sure that you do it in a coherent way.(Here elliptic curves can be replaced by any other moduli problem you can think of, of course.)	8
901	631	There are a few subtleties that will probably effect the final answer.Are we required to find the solution, or merely establish existence? By analogy, determining if a number has a prime factorization is trivial, but finding its prime factorization is hard.Is the runtime being measured in terms of {a_1,...,a_n,s} or {log(a_i),...,log(a_n),log(s)}? By analogy, SUBSET-SUM is in P in the first case, but NP-complete in the second case.	2
902	518	This is a comment on the proof sketch in the question: the localization $A_P$ is local of dimension zero (its unique maximal ideal is also a minimal prime ideal, and hence is the unique prime ideal of $A_P$), but need not be Artinian, as far as I can tell.  E.g. if $A =\mathbb C[[x^{1/2},x^{1/3},\dots]]/(x)$, then $A$ is local with a unique prime ideal (namely the ideal generated by all the $x^{1/n}$), but is not Artinian (equivalently, not Noetherian), since if $(a_i)$ is any strictly descending sequence of rational numbers in the interval $(0,1)$, then the ideals $x^{a_i}A$ form a strictly descending sequence of ideals in $A$.(Hopefully I'm not blundering here; if I am, someone please let me know!)(Also, I should add that it is still the case that since $PA_P$ is the unique minimal prime of $A_P$, every element of $PA_P$ is nilpotent, and hence every element of $P$ is a zero divisor, so my comment is very nitpicky: it is just about the use of the terminology Artinian.)	7

905	29	Try sage.  It's like python (it is actually written in python, and uses something similar to a python shell), but with a vastly larger set of built-in mathematical operations.	6
906	29	Some people have suggested Sage or Python. Sage can do the symbolic manipulation that TI calculators can do using Maxima. Python with the right packages can do this as well (SymPy package I believe). Plus these things will be programmable. Sage however is fairly heavy at a few GB if I recall correctly. I'm not sure if there is anyway to interface with Maxima through Python like in Sage without actually having Sage.	3
907	Correct usage of the phrase "In the sequel"? History? Alternatives?	While I feel quite confident that I've inferred the correct meaning of "In the sequel" from context, I've never heard anyone explicitly tell me, so first off, to remove my niggling doubts: What does this phrase mean?(Someone recently argued to me that "sequel" was actually supposed to refer to a forthcoming second part of a paper, which I found highly unlikely, but I'd just like to make sure. )My main questions: At what points in the text, and for what kinds of X, is it appropriate to use the phrase "In the sequel, X" in a paper? In a book? Is it ever acceptable to introduce definitions via "In the sequel, we introduce the concept of a "blah", which is a thing satisfying ..." at the start of a paper or book without a formal"Definition. A "blah" is a thing, satsifying ..."in the main text of the paper or book? Finally, out of curiosity, I'm wondering how long this phrase has been around, if it's considered out of date or if it's still a popular phrase, and what some good alternatives are.	12
908	907	I would never write that (mostly because it really sounds like the definition will be in another paper...). I'm pretty sure I'd write «In what follows, ...».	2
910	855	In fact the result holds a bit more generally, namely:Lemma $\rm\ \ 24\ |\ M^2 - N^2 \;$ if $\rm \; M,N \perp 6, \;$ i.e. coprime to $6.\;$ The proof is easy:  $\rm\quad\quad\quad N\perp 2 \;\Rightarrow\; N = \pm 1, \pm 3 \pmod 8 \;\Rightarrow\; N^2 = 1 \pmod 8$ $\rm\quad\quad\quad N\perp 3 \;\Rightarrow\; N \;\;= \;\;\;\pm 1\ \pmod 3 \;\Rightarrow\; N^2 = 1 \pmod 3 \;$So $\rm \quad\; 3, 8\ |\ N^2 - 1 \;\Rightarrow\;  24\ |\ N^2 - 1 \ $ since $\ {\rm lcm}(3,8) = 24.$This is a special case $\rm\ n = 24\ $ of this much more general result  Theorem $\ $  For naturals $\rm\ a,e,n $ with $\rm\ e,n>1 $$\rm\quad n\ |\ a^e-1$ for all $\rm a\perp n \ \iff\  \phi'(p^k)\:|\:e\ $ for all $\rm\ p^k\:|\:n,\ \ p\:$ primewith $\rm \;\;\; \phi'(p^k) = \phi(p^k)\ $ for odd primes $\rm p\:,\ $ where $\phi$ is Euler's totient functionand   $\rm\ \quad \phi'(2^k) = 2^{k-2}\ $ if $\rm  k>2\:,\ $ else $\,2$The latter exception is due to $\rm \mathbb Z/2^k$ having multiplicative group $\rm C(2) \times C(2^{k-2})$ for $\rm k>2$.Notice that the least such exponent $\rm e$ is given by $\rm \;\lambda(n)\; = \;{\rm lcm}\;\{\phi'(\;{p_i}^{k_i})\}\;$ where $\rm \; n = \prod {p_i}^{k_i}\;$.  $\rm\lambda(n)$ is called the (universal) exponent of the group $\rm \mathbb Z/n^*,\;$ a.k.a. the Carmichael function.So the case at hand is simply $\rm\ \lambda(24) = lcm(\phi'(2^3),\phi'(3)) = lcm(2,2) = 2\:.$See my post here for proofs and further discussion.	16
911	250	Scott Aaronson once basically did this for a bunch of theorems in computer science here and here.  I particularly like this one:  Suppose a baby is given some random examples of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences, and based on that, it wants to infer the general rule for whether or not a given sentence is grammatical. If the baby can do this with reasonable accuracy and in a reasonable amount of time, for any “regular grammar” (the very simplest type of grammar studied by Noam Chomsky), then that baby can also break the RSA cryptosystem.	44
912	796	There is an extremely beautiful Lie-theoretic approach to separation of variables,e.g. see Willard Miller's book [1] (freely downloadable). I quote from his introduction:  This book is concerned with the  relationship between symmetries of a   linear second-order partial  differential equation of mathematical  physics,  the coordinate systems in  which the equation admits solutions  via separation  of variables, and the  properties of the special functions  that arise in  this manner. It is an  introduction intended for anyone with  experience in  partial differential  equations, special functions, or Lie  group theory, such  as group  theorists, applied mathematicians,  theoretical physicists and  chemists,  and electrical engineers. We will  exhibit some modem group-theoretic   twists in the ancient method of  separation of variables that can be   used to provide a foundation for much  of special function theory. In   particular, we will show explicitly  that all special functions that arise   via separation of variables in the  equations of mathematical physics can   be studied using group theory. These  include the functions of Lam6, Ince,   Mathieu, and others, as well as those  of hypergeometric type.   This is a very critical time in the  history of group-theoretic methods in   special function theory. The basic  relations between Lie groups, special   functions, and the method of  separation of variables have recently  been  clarified. One can now construct  a group-theoretic machine that, when   applied to a given differential  equation of mathematical physics,  describes  in a rational manner the  possible coordinate systems in which  the equation  admits solutions via  separation of variables and the  various expansion  theorems relating  the separable (special function)  solutions in distinct  coordinate  systems. Indeed for the most important  linear equations, the  separated  solutions are characterized as common  eigenfunctions of sets of   second-order commuting elements in the  universal enveloping algebra of  the  Lie symmetry algebra corresponding to  the equation. The problem of   expanding one set of separable  solutions in terms of another reduces  to a  problem in the representation  theory of the Lie symmetry algebra.[1] Willard Miller. Symmetry and Separation of Variables.Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1977 (out of print)  	2

916	874	Alright, I'm not 100% sure I'm understanding this correctly. You say that p can be located on the right or top line and that p2 can be located on the bottom or left line. Do you mean the rectangle can be rotated? If that's the case, the question should say that p can be on the right or bottom line of the rectangle. Also, are you looking for two separate answers or one that works both when p2 is on the bottom and on the left?If you do mean that the rectangle can be rotated, and want two different answers, it's pretty simple. First I'll deal with when p2 is on the bottom and p is on the right.Since p2 is on the bottom line we know the y-coordinate is h, according to the diagram. We also know that p is (0,y). Because of the 45 degree angle, we know that the distance between p's y-coordinate and the lower right corner is the same as the distance between the lower right corner and p2's x-coordinate, which in this case is p2's x-coordinate. Therefore, the coordinates of p2 are (h-y, h).If p2 is on the left and p is on the bottom, it's very similar. Since p2 is on the left, it's x-coordinate is h. Because p is on the x-axis, it's (x,0). Because of the 45 degree angle, the distance between the lower left corner and p is the same as the distance between the lower left corner and p2, which this time gives us p2's y-coordinate. Therefore the coordinates of p2 are (h,h-x).Hopefully I understood your intentions correctly. If not, I hope you can use my misunderstandings to further improve your question.	1
917	250	My favorite would probably be Goodstein's theorem:Start with your favorite number (mine is $37$) and express it in hereditary base $2$ notation.  That is, write it as a power of $2$ with exponents powers of $2$, etc.So, $37 = 2^{(2^2 + 1)} + 2^2 + 1$.  This is the first element of the sequence.Next, change all the $2$'s to $3$'s, and subtract one from what's remaining and express in hereditary base $3$ notation.We get $3^{(3^3 + 1)} + 3^3 + 1 - 1= 3^{(3^3 + 1)} + 3^3$ (which is roughly $2 \times 10^{13}$).  This is the second element of the sequence.Next, change all $3$'s to $4$'s, subtract one, and express in hereditary base $4$ notation.We get $4^{(4^4 + 1)} + 4^4 - 1 = 4^{(4^4 + 1)} + 3*4^3 + 3*4^2 + 3*4 + 3$ (which is roughly $5 \times 10^{154}$) .  This is the third element of the sequence.Rinse, repeat:  at the $n^{th}$ stage, change all the "$n+1$" to "$n+2$", subtract $1$, and reexpress in hereditary base $n+2$ notation.The theorem is: no matter which number you start with, eventually, your sequence hits 0, despite the fact that it grows VERY quickly at the start.For example, if instead of starting with $37$, we started with $4$, then (according to the wikipedia page), it takes $3*2^{(402653211)} - 2$ steps ( VERY roughly $10^{(100,000,000)}$, or a $1$ followed by a hundred million $0$s).  $37$ takes vastly longer to drop to $0$.	121
918	How do I count the subsets of a set whose number of elements is divisible by 3? 4?	Let $S$ be a set of size $n$.  There is an easy way to count the number of subsets with an even number of elements.  Algebraically, it comes from the fact that$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} = (1 + 1)^n$while$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k {n \choose k} = (1 - 1)^n$.It follows that $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n/2} {n \choose 2k} = 2^{n-1}$.  A direct combinatorial proof is as follows: fix an element $s \in S$.  If a given subset has $s$ in it, add it in; otherwise, take it out.  This defines a bijection between the number of subsets with an even number of elements and the number of subsets with an odd number of elements.The analogous formulas for the subsets with a number of elements divisible by $3$ or $4$ are more complicated, and divide into cases depending on the residue of $n \bmod 6$ and $n \bmod 8$, respectively.  The algebraic derivations of these formulas are as follows (with $\omega$ a primitive third root of unity):  observe that$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} \omega^k {n \choose k} = (1 + \omega)^n = (-\omega^2)^n$while$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} \omega^{2k} {n \choose k} = (1 + \omega^2)^n = (-\omega)^n$and that $1 + \omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 0$ if $k$ is not divisible by $3$ and equals $3$ otherwise.  (This is a special case of the discrete Fourier transform.)  It follows that$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n/3} {n \choose 3k} = \frac{2^n + (-\omega)^n + (-\omega)^{2n}}{3}.$$-\omega$ and $-\omega^2$ are sixth roots of unity, so this formula splits into six cases (or maybe three).  Similar observations about fourth roots of unity show that$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n/4} {n \choose 4k} = \frac{2^n + (1+i)^n + (1-i)^n}{4}$where $1+i = \sqrt{2} e^{ \frac{\pi i}{4} }$ is a scalar multiple of an eighth root of unity, so this formula splits into eight cases (or maybe four).  Question:  Does anyone know a direct combinatorial proof of these identities? 	35
919	636	I was recently surprised to discover that it's actually not known (edit: see below). The number of closed knight's tours (cyclic) was computed in the 1990s, using binary decision diagrams. There are 26,534,728,821,064 closed directed knight's tours, and the number of undirected ones is half that or 13,267,364,410,532. If you count equivalence classes under rotation and reflection, there are slightly more than 1/8th of that: 1,658,420,855,433.(Loebbing and  Wegener (1996) wrote a paper "The Number of Knight's Tours Equals 33,439,123,484,294 — Counting with Binary Decision Diagrams"; the number in the title in the mistake, as they pointed out in a comment to their paper. Brendon McKay independently computed the correct number with another method, and the original authors seem to have later found the same answer.)Finding the exact number of open tours (not cyclic/reentrant) was open, but was estimated to be about 1015 or 2×1016.Edit: Please see and upvote the answer by user rantonse below, pointing out that Alex Chernov appears to have calculated the total number of knight's tours (including non-cyclic ones).	16
920	20	I think you were being a little too hard on Isaac.  The truth is that the real numbers are a sophisticated mathematical construction and that any explanation of what they "are" which pretends otherwise is a convenient fiction.  Mathematicians need these kind of sophisticated constructions because they are what is required for rigorous proofs.  Before people explicitly constructed the real numbers and used them to define and prove things about other concepts, it was never totally clear what was true or what was false, and everybody was very confused.For example, Cantor proved that the number of points in the plane is the same as the number of  points on a line.  Many people thought that this was impossible before he did it; they had an intuition that you couldn't possibly "fit" the plane into the line.  More generally, people were pretty sure you couldn't fit $\mathbb{R}^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$ if $n$ was greater than $m$.  It wasn't until quite a bit later that mathematicians formalized and proved a rigorous mathematical statement which justified this intuition called invariance of domain, which says you can't do this in a continuous way.  One of the many mathematical constructions you need to even state this theorem is the construction of the real numbers.  (Another is a formal definition of what "continuous" means, but one thing at a time.)So, what are the real numbers?  They are a formal way to fill "holes" in the rational numbers, which is necessary for all sorts of things.  The most basic thing they are necessary for is doing geometry.  You probably know that the square root of 2 is irrational.  What this means is that it is impossible to think about the diagonal of a square as being the same kind of object as the sides of a square while only using rational numbers.  But you can rotate a diagonal, and it looks just like the side of a square, only a bit longer.  So you'd like a number system in which you can sensibly talk about any number you can construct geometrically.  You'd also like to be able to talk about rotation!  You can't do that with just rational numbers, either.So how do you fill in enough holes to do geometry?  Dedekind came up with a very clever way to do this.  It starts by observing that a rational number $q$ is completely determined by the set of rational numbers greater than it and the set of rational numbers less than it.  For example, 1/2 is completely determined by the fact that it's always between 1/2 + 1/n and 1/2 - 1/n.  (For the initiated, this is a special case of the Yoneda lemma.)  But there are "numbers," such as the square root of 2, which aren't rational, and yet have the property that we can always tell what rational numbers are greater than it and what rational numbers are less than it.  For the square root of 2, these are precisely the fractions p/q such that 2q^2 < p^2 and such that 2q^2 > p^2, respectively.  Dedekind's brilliant idea was the following:  Define a real number to be a partition of the rational numbers!In Dedekind's construction, the square root of 2 quite literally is the set of rational numbers that are greater than it, and the set of rational numbers that are less than it. You can define all the usual arithmetic operations on these "numbers," called Dedekind cuts, and prove all the wonderful theorems you'll find in a standard book on real analysis.  In particular, the property that guarantees that all the holes are filled is called completeness.   Figured I might as well add something about the complex numbers.  The story here is beautiful, and if you're really interested you should check out Tristan Needham's Visual Complex Analysis.  Some people say that the point of the complex numbers is to let you solve polynomials, but this is really selling them short.  The complex numbers are an inherently geometric construction, and should be understood as such.  Their geometry and topology just happens to be responsible for the fact that you can solve polynomials with them, but it's also responsible for much more.Here is a quick sketch.  Now that you've got the real numbers on your hands, you can rigorously talk about plane geometry.  In plane geometry, an important notion is that of similarity.  Informally, two figures are similar if they have the same shape.  More formally, two figures are similar if you can rotate, translate, and scale one figure so that it matches up with the other.  So similarity is all about a certain collection of transformations of the points in the plane.  It was Klein who first realized that the important features of different flavors of "geometry" are captured in what kind of transformations are allowed.  So to do geometry the modern way we should focus our attention on these transformations, which form a group.To make this easier, let's ignore the translations for now.  We'll pick an origin for our plane, and we'll only allow rotations and scalings about this origin.  Rotations and scalings have the property that they are both linear transformations; this means that if you know what the transformation does to two points $u, v$, you also know what it does to the vector sum $u + v$.  In particular, a linear transformation is determined by what it does to the point $(1, 0)$ and to the point $(0, 1)$.  However, rotations and scalings satisfy an extra property: they are, in fact, determined by what they do to the point $(1, 0)$.  This is because $(0, 1)$ can be obtained from $(1, 0)$ by a rotation by 90 degrees, and rotations and scalings commute with each other: if you rotate x degrees then y degrees, that's the same as rotating y degrees then x degrees, which is the same as rotating x+y degrees.  Similarly, if you rotate x degrees then scale by 2, that's the same as scaling by 2, then rotating x degrees.  So if you know what a rotation-and-scaling does to $(1, 0)$, you just rotate that vector by 90 degrees, and you know what it did to $(0, 1)$.So to every rotation-and-scaling, we can assign two real numbers: the coordinates of the image of the point $(1, 0)$.  In general, a rotation by $\theta$ angles followed by a scaling by $r$ sends $(1, 0)$ to $(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta)$.  A different transformation, say a rotation by $\phi$ angles followed by a scaling by $s$, sends $(1, 0)$ to $(s \cos \phi, s \sin \phi)$.  And their composition sends $(1, 0)$ to $(rs \cos (\theta + \phi), rs \sin (\theta + \phi))$.  In other words, composition of rotations-and-scalings defines a multiplication law on pairs of real numbers.  What is this law, exactly?  Well, by the angle addition formulas, it's$$(a, b) * (c, d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc).$$And this is precisely the rule for multiplication in the complex numbers, where $(a, b)$ corresponds to $a + bi$.  You get the rule for addition by observing that not only can you compose two rotations-and-scalings, you can also add their results. Together, the real numbers and the complex numbers provide a foundation for much of modern mathematics and physics.  For example, the complex numbers turn out (for reasons which are still not well understood) to be fundamental in the description of quantum mechanics.	16
923	20	The natural numbers are defined by the Peano axioms, as in the answer of Isaac. You can also view the natural numbers as the cardinalities of finite sets, which implies that zero is a natural number.Now the other number domains arise because mathematicians want to give values for certain operations which otherwise are only defined partially. Alternatively, they want to give solutions to equations of certain forms, which cannot always be solved in the smaller domain.integers arise from subtraction (solutions of a + x = b)rational numbers arise from division (solutions of a * x = b)real numbers arise from taking limits or upper boundscomplex numbers arise from taking roots (solutions of polynomial equations)cardinal numbers arise as the sizes of sets. They can be constructed as isomorphism classes of sets, e.g. the number one would then be the class of all sets containing one element. They are useful for talking about the different sizes of infinite sets, which can get extremely large. Some set theorists compete over who can define the largest cardinal.ordinal numbers arise as the sizes of well-orderings. They can be constructed as isomorphism classes of well-orderings, e.g. the number two would then be the class of all well-orderings containing two elements (with the first smaller than the second in the ordering). Interestingly, the ordinals are themselves well-ordered in a single well-ordering, so they come in a well-defined sequence, and an ordinal number can be viewed as describing its position in this sequence.	5
924	907	Your interpretation of how "in the sequel" is used in mathematical literature is correct: it means "in what follows", "in the remainder of the present text", "from now on"...As you can see, there are many other such expressions, and I don't think that "in the sequel" has any particular nuance of meaning that these other phrasings lack.  On to your question of whether this is acceptable usage in a math paper: acceptable, yes, but not completely recommended.  In more detail:Ths phrase is, as you point out, rather common, so any experienced reader of math will have seen it before.  Also its meaning should be relatively transparent to a literate native speaker of English: this is after all what the dictionary says that "sequel" means.However, there are two drawbacks.  First, as Mariano says, nowadays we hear "sequel" used most commonly for the next movie in a franchise, so its use in a math paper will inevitably make some readers think that you are referring to [TITLE OF YOUR PAPER] Part II: This Time, It's Personal, or whatever.  Second, in my opinion it is somewhat hackneyed language and an idiomatic usage that doesn't add any meaning.  If you read enough math papers you'll find that there are certain linguistic ticks that people pick up from each other (and also sometimes, from writing in other languages), e.g. beginning a sentence with "Remark that..." sounds a little stilted and is probably a semiconscious translation of the french phrase "Remarquer que" (which I would translate as "Notice that").  Most people agree that good mathematical writing is as stylistically unobstrusive as possible, so using phrases that make people ponder and ask questions about them on websites is, arguably, slightly too distracting.  Anyway, it's  no big deal.  If I were a referee or even a copyeditor, I would almost certainly let the author use "in the sequel" if she wants.	25
928	894	We can define formula $P_i$ that says "there are at most $i$ elements satisfying $P$". Now, if the infinite disjunction of the $P_i$ was definable in FO, it would (by compactness) imply a conjunction of some finite subset of the $P_i$, hence it would imply $P_i$ for some $i$. That is not true, if $P$ can have (say) $i+1$ elements satisfying it.	15
929	918	Fix two elements s1,s2∈S and divide subsets of S into two parts (subsets of S containing only s2)∪(subsets of S which contains s1 if they contain s2). The second part contains equal number of sets for all reminders mod 3 (because Z/3 acts there adding s1, then s2, then removing both of them) -- namely, 2n-2. And for the first part we have a bijection with subsets (edit: with 2 mod 3 elements) of a set with (n-2) elements.So we get a recurrence relation that gives an answer 2n-2+2n-4+... -- i.e. (2n-1):3 for even and (2n-2):3 for odd n.Errata. For n=0,1,5 mod 6 one should add "+1" to the answer from the previous paragraph (e.g. for n=6 the correct answer is 1+20+1=22 and not 21).Let me try to rephrase the solution to make it obvious. For n=2k divide S on k pairs and consider an action of a group Z/3Z on each pair described in a first paragraph. We get an action of (Z/3Z)k on subsets of S, and after removal of it's only fixed point (k-element set consisting of second points from each pair) we get a bijection between subsets which have 0, 1 or 2 elements mod 3. So there are (2n-1):3 sets with i mod 3 elements excluding the fixed point and to count that point one should add "+1" for i=k mod 3.And for n=2k+1 there are 2 fixed points — including or not (2k+1)-th element of S — with k+1 and k elements respectively.	11
930	855	This is somewhere between an answer and commentary.  As others have said, the question is equivalent to showing: for any prime $p > 3$, $p^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ and $p^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 8$.  Both of these statements are straightforward to show by just looking at the $\varphi(3) = 2$ reduced residue classes modulo $3$ and the $\varphi(8) = 4$ reduced residue classes modulo $8$.  But what is their significance?For a positive integer $n$, let $U(n) = (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ be the multiplicative group of units ("reduced residues") modulo $n$.  Like any abelian group $G$, we have a squaring map$[2]: G \rightarrow G$, $g \mapsto g^2$,the image of which is the set of squares in $G$.  So, the question is equivalent to: for $n = 3$ and also $n = 8$, the subgroup of squares in $U(n)$ is the trivial group.  The group $U(3) = \{ \pm 1\}$ has order $2$; since $(-1)^2 = 1$, the fact that the subgroup of squares is equal to $1$ is pretty clear.  But more generally, for any odd prime $p$, the squaring map $[2]$ on $U(p)$ is two-to-one onto its image -- an element of a field has no more than two square roots -- so that precisely half of the elements of $U(p)$ are squares.  It turns out that when $p = 3$, half of $p-1$ is $1$, but of course this is somewhat unusual: it doesn't happen for any other odd prime $p$.The group $U(8) = \{1,3,5,7\}$ has order $4$.  By analogy to the case of $U(p)$, one might expect the squaring map to be two-to-one onto its image so that exactly half of the elements are squares.  But that is not what is happening here: indeed $1^2 \equiv 3^2 \equiv 5^2 \equiv 7^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 8$,so the subgroup of squares is again trivial.  What's different?  Since $\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field, it is legal for a given element to have more than two square roots, but a more insightful answer comes from the structure of the groups $U(n)$.  For any odd prime $p$, the group $U(p)$ is cyclic of order $p-1$ ("existence of primitive roots").  It is easy to see that in any cyclic group of even order, exactly half of the elements are squares.  So $U(8)$ must not be cyclic, so it must be the other abelian group of order $4$, i.e., isomorphic to the Klein $4$-group $C_2 \times C_2$.  More generally, if $p$ is an odd prime number and $a$ is a positive integer, then $U(p^a)$ is cyclic of order $p^{a-1}(p-1)$ hence isomorphic to $C_{p^{a-1}} \times C_{p-1}$, whereas for any $a \geq 2$, the group $U(2^a)$ is isomorphic to $C_{2^{a-2}} \times C_2$.  This is one of the first signs in number theory "there is something odd about the prime $2$".  Added: Note that the above considerations allow us to answer the more general question: "What is the largest positive integer $N$ such that for all primes $p$ with $\operatorname{gcd}(p,N) = 1$, $N$ divides $(p^2-1)$?"  (Answer: $N = 24$.)  Added Later: I just saw this arxiv preprint which is entirely devoted to the observation made in the previous paragraph.  I guess the author does not follow this site...	21
931	8	Also you can use the matrix equation for Fibonacci numbers:$$  \begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}^n  =  \begin{pmatrix}F_{n+1}&F_{n}\\F_{n}&F_{n-1}\end{pmatrix}$$To calculate $n$-th power of the matrix you can use exponentiation by squaring algorithm.This approach could also be generalized on the case of arbitrary sequence with linear recurrence relation.	20
932	59	In case you want to implement it on some programming language.Usually there is a function called like atan2(y, x) which returns oriented angle between points (x, y) and (1, 0). In that case use could useatan2(vector product, scalar product).This is usually more stable than using just arccos or arcsin.	0
933	806	As others have said, often what you want for a particular Diophantine application is that the class number of a certain number field be relatively prime to a certain number.  The famous example of this (as already noted by others) is Kummer's Theorem that for an odd prime $p$, the Fermat equation $x^p + y^p = z^p$ has no integer solutions with $xyz \neq 0$ if the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}[e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{p}}]$ has class number prime to $p$.Another -- simpler -- nice example is the Mordell equation $y^2 + k = x^3$.  If $k \equiv 1,2 \pmod 4$ and the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-k}]$ has class number prime to $3$, then all of the integer solutions to the Mordell equation can be found.  See Section 4 ofhttp://math.uga.edu/~pete/4400MordellEquation.pdffor an exposition of this which is (I hope) reasonably elementary and accessible to undergraduates. 	11
934	8	To expand on falagar's answer, my favourite proof of Binet's formula:...Which I was going to post a summary of here, but remembered that everything was awful without Tex, so here is a link to some notes on it I found on google.The basic idea is to treat pairs of fibonnacci numbers, adjacent in the sequence, as vectors. Moving on to the next adjacent pair induces a linear transformation not unlike that of the matrix falagar posted. Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors can give a complete prediction of where an initial vector will find itself, predicting the whole sequence.It's quite a lot of work but I think it's rather illuminating.	3
935	594	Here is another proof without complex numbers.We start with proving that there exists $z \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $z^2 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod p$. We do this in the same way as Akhil Mathew.Let we have $a^2 + b^2 = pm$. Take $x$ and $y$ such that$x \equiv a \pmod m$ and$y \equiv b \pmod m$ and$x, y \in [-m/2, m/2)$.Consider $u = ax + by$ and $v = ay - bx$. Then $u^2 + v^2 = (a^2 + b^2)(x^2 + y^2)$.Moreover, $u$ and $v$ are multiples of $m$.Hence $(u/m)^2 + (v/m)^2 = p (x^2 + y^2)/m$. $(x^2 + y^2)/m$ is an integer because of the definition of $x$ and $y$ and that $a^2 + b^2 = pm$.Also $(x^2 + y^2)/m$ is less than $m/2$.Now we change $a$ by $u$ and $b$ by $v$ and continue this process until we get $m=1$.Notice that this is quite efficient way to find representation of $p$ as a sum of two squares - it takes $O(\log p)$ steps to find it provided we have found $z$ such that $z^2 + 1$ is multiple of $p$.	5
936	Looking for functions $f$ with $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)\,dx = 1$.	I am looking for functions and/or constants that when being integrated from minus infinity to infinity produce 1. I think the Dirac delta function is one example but perhaps there are some more? References  on useful material is also greatly appreciated.	6
937	936	Any integrable functions that gives a finite nonzero answer can be modified to suit your need.Suppose $\int f(x)dx=A$, then let $g(x)=f(x)/A$, automatically we have $\int g(x) dx=A/A=1$.(Actually, all continuous probability distribution function must have this property.)	18
938	653	Homotopy theory is useful in quantum mechanics when (for instance) talking about manifolds of Hamiltonians.  You might have a collection of Hamiltonians that depend continuously on some parameters $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ such that the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian is periodic in some subset of the parameters $p_{r_1}, p_{r_2}, \ldots, p_{r_m}$.  From this, the fundamental group of the manifold of Hamiltonians can be computed, which has some physical ramifications.A concrete example of this would be the Hamiltonian that describes the quantum hall effect.  The quantum hall effect is the phenomena that the resistance in a 2-dimensional substrate exposed to a perpendicular electric field at close to zero temperature is quantized.  In condensed matter physics there is a notion called quasimomentum that can be thought of as being related to momentum but is a bit different.  We need something different from the classical definition of momentum because the classical definition depends on translation invariance, and in a crystal there is only discrete translation invariance.  In the quantum hall effect, we have two quasimomenta: $k_x, and k_y$, corresponding to quasimomentum in the $x$ and $y$ directions.  The Hamiltonian is periodic in both of these parameters, leading to a fundamental group of the manifold of Hamiltonians of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, i.e. the fundamental group of the torus $T^2$.There's a lot more to the topic than this.  This paper by Avron, Seiler, and Simon has more details:Homotopy and Quantization in Condensed Matter Physics	1

Am I correct to state the both interchangeably whenever I need to express the approximation of pi? I'm bit confused as here it states pi can be express by ≒ as it's not a rational number, but pi can also be expressed by a series (asymptotic), so it should be ≈ as well.π ≈ 3.14..π ≒ 3.14..	8

Show that $X$ contains a closed point.Well I'm unable to do this question, so any help would be appreciated. This question also makes me curious to know about the meaning/use of closed points of a scheme in general - by that I mean a scheme which is not an algebraic variety/local scheme over a field, which has a geometric meaning. Thanks!	16
944	Proving the Riemann Hypothesis without revealing anything other than you proved it	Consider the following assertion from Scott Aaronson's blog:  Supposing you do prove the Riemann  Hypothesis, it’s possible to convince  someone of that fact, without  revealing anything other than the fact  that you proved it. It’s also possible  to write the proof down in such a way  that someone else could verify it,  with very high confidence, having only  seen 10 or 20 bits of the proof.Can anyone explain where this result comes from?	11
945	941	Any mathematical notation is ok as long as it is common knowledge in your community. For instance, I believe I fully understand the meaning of the $\approx$ symbol. However, I haven't ever seen the second symbol you provided.To be on the sure side you should provide a definition of any relation symbol you don't consider to be common knowledge. This may happen as a short remark ("..., where $\approx$ denotes ...") or maybe as a table of the used symbols in the front matter of your work. As with any definition in mathematics, there is no right or wrong in the symbol/notion/etc. you use, only proper or unsound definitions.Also: When in doubt, use the symbol that is used more commonly in the standard textbooks of your field. There is no benefit in being avant-garde at notation.	16

948	942	Zorn's lemma implies there is a minimal nonempty closed set $F \subset X$ with no proper closed subsets (because the closed sets have the finite intersection property in view of quasi-compactness).  It is sufficient to find a closed point in $F$. Now $F$ is in itself a scheme, and it has an open subset $U=\mathrm{Spec}\, A$ for $A$ a ring. This must be all of $F$ by minimality.  A maximal ideal in $A$ gives a closed point in $F$, hence in $X$.There are people here who could give a much better answer to your other question, so I'll leave it.	12
949	Probability to find connected pixels	Say I have an image, with pixels that can be either $0$ or $1$. For simplicity, assume it's a $2D$ image (though I'd be interested in a $3D$ solution as well). A pixel has $8$ neighbors (if that's too complicated, we can drop to $4$-connectedness). Two neighboring pixels with value $1$ are considered to be connected. If I know the probability $p$ that an individual pixel is $1$, and if I can assume that all pixels are independent, how many groups of at least $k$ connected pixels should I expect to find in an image of size $n\times n$?What I really need is a good way of calculating the probability of $k$ pixels being connected given the individual pixel probabilities. I have started to write down a tree to cover all the possibilities up to $k=3$, but even then, it becomes really ugly really fast. Is there a more clever way to go about this?	5
950	944	The correct answer has already been given by Akhil Mathew in the comments above.The topic belongs to the field of complexity theory in computer science. In complexity theory, there exists an intriguing concept for the problem of deciding whether a given word belongs to a given formal language or not: interactive proof systems. These systems model the interaction between resource-limited verifier (say, you or me) and an almighty prover (say, your much, much smarter older sister). The goal of the interaction is that the prover convinces the verifier from the fact that the given word is or is not an element of the language such that:almost surely, the verfier can only be convinced from the true answer andthe verifier can only be fooled to believe the opposite within a very small margin of error.There are a large number of theoretical results with respect to these interactive systems. These resuts include the follwoing two statements (given informally):everything that can be proven by such an interactive protocoll can also be proven using an interactive protocoll that convinces the verifier (within small margin of error) but it does not reveal any information about the proof itself. (Zero-Knowledge-Proof, "Everything provable is provable in zero-knowledge" by Ben-Or et al, 1988)every proof can be rewritten such that inspection of just a constant number of bits from this proof convinces the verifier within only a small margin of error (PCP-Theorem, "Proof verification and the hardness of approximation problems" by Arora et al, 1992, and a number of other papers)Both of these concepts and results are highly non-trivial and beyond the scope of this forum.Of course, in the quote above Scott Aaronson is just using some everyday's problem to illustrate these concepts. To use these results formally, would have to convert the task of "proving the Riemann Hypothesis" to a decision problem of formal languages, as is standard in complexity theory.EDIT: There is in fact a small modification in the model between both results stated above which I omitted. First, the interaction between one prover and the verifier can be generalized to multiple provers and a verifier. Next, there is a result that finds that the case of multiple provers can be equivalently reformulated as follows: The provers are removed from the protocol, rather there is a single (possibly very long) string which acts as a written proof for the word problem. Interaction is now looking at an arbitrarily chosen bit of this proof, and the verifier may choose the location of these bits randomly. This is called a Probabilistic Checkable Proof (hence, PCP). So ,in this scenario, the "written proof" of the Riemann Hypothesis would be interpreted as the proof string.	11
951	Visualising functions from complex numbers to complex numbers	I think that complex analysis is hard because graphs of even basic functions are 4 dimensional. Does anyone have any good visual representations of basic complex functions or know of any tools for generating them?	9
952	951	One way that functions from C to C can be represented is to show the image of a grid.  That is, plot the images of the lines x = constant and y = constant under your function, where z = x + yi.  Another is what Wikipedia calls domain coloring (see this article by Hans Lundmark for a more detailed exposition.  The idea here is to color the range of the complex function -- since color space is three-dimensional there are multiple ways to do this -- and then color each point in the domain by the color of the corresponding point in the range.	12
953	936	One good example is the standard Gaussian distribution, $\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}$.  This is the most straightforward example of a continuous probability distribution function as mentioned by KennyTM above.	5

However, in non-commutative geometry you want to replace the algebra of functions on a space with a non-commutative algebra, giving a non-commutative Hopf algebra.This relates to quantum mechanics because there the analog of the classical coordinate functions of position and momentum do not commute.  Therefore we think of the algebra of functions on a quantum "space" as being non-commutative.	3

What kind of answer do you want? What kind of properties do you want your functions to have?There really are too many functions to list, since multiplying any function by a C^oo function with compact support and then applying Kenny's trick gives you an answer.	4

A large list of such functions can be found here.  A few more notable examples are:The normal distributionThe skew-normal distributionThe t-distributionThe cauchy distributionThe extreme-value distribution	7

977	942	Closed points should be thought of as being "actual points", whereas non-closed points can correspond to all sorts of different things: subvarieties, "fat" or "fuzzy" points, generic points, etc. You might be interested in reading this blog post about Mumford's drawing of $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}[x]$.One possible way to justify the claim that closed points are the "actual points" is the fact that if we have, for instance, a smooth variety over $\mathbb{C}$, then its analytification will be a complex manifold. The closed points of the former will then correspond exactly to the points of the latter.	10
978	How to prove and interpret $\operatorname{rank}(AB) \leq \operatorname{min}(\operatorname{rank}(A), \operatorname{rank}(B))$?	  Let $A$ and $B$ be two matrices which can be multiplied. Then $$\operatorname{rank}(AB) \leq \operatorname{min}(\operatorname{rank}(A), \operatorname{rank}(B)).$$I proved $\operatorname{rank}(AB) \leq \operatorname{rank}(B)$ interpreting $AB$ as a composition of linear maps, observing that $\operatorname{ker}(B) \subseteq \operatorname{ker}(AB)$ and using the kernel-image dimension formula. This also provides, in my opinion, a nice interpretation: if non stable, under subsequent compositions the kernel can only get bigger, and the image can only get smaller, in a sort of loss of information.How to manage $\operatorname{rank}(AB) \leq \operatorname{rank}(A)$? Is there a nice interpretation like the previous one?	26
979	951	For Moebius transformations, check out this nice YouTube video.	5
981	978	Yes. If you think of A and B as linear maps, then the domain of A is certainly at least as big as the image of B. Thus when we apply A to either of these things, we should get "more stuff" in the former case, as the former is bigger than the latter.	18
982	978	Prove first that if $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are functions between finite sets, then $|g(f(X))| \leq \min \{ |f(X)|, |g(Y)| \}.$Then use the same idea.	7
983	980	The rigorous definition of open and closed sets is fundamental to topology: you define a topology by saying what its open sets are.  From this perspective, open and closed sets are axiomatic, like points and lines in geometry.  In any case, closed sets are the complements of open sets and vice versa.The most familiar example of open sets would be open intervals on the real line, intervals of the form {x : a < x < b}. Such sets and their arbitrary unions define the standard topology on the real line.  Note that the paragraph above describes the standard topology, but not the only one.  You could put a very different topology on the real line.  That's because a topology is determined by what you call open sets and not by the underlying space per se.  For example, another topology on the real line defines a set to be open if its complement has only a finite number of points. 	4
984	942	Kevin Lin's answer regarding the meaning of closed points is quite reasonable, especialy in the case when the scheme in question underlies a classical variety.  I want to add some additional remarks and examples for thinking about more general schemes.Here are some tautological remarks: recall that a point x in a scheme X is called a specialization of y if x lies in the Zariski closure of y (and y is called a generalization of x).  So tautologically, a closed points is one that cannot be specialized any further (just as a generic point cannot be generalized any further).  What does specialization really mean:ring theoretically, it means taking the image under a homomorphism; so if p and q are primeideals of a ring A, then q is a specialization of p in Spec A if and only if q contains p, i.e. if A/p surjects onto A/q.  It is perhaps best to think of an example: say A is C[x,y],p is the prime ideal gen'd by (x-1) and q is the prime (actually maximal ideal) gen'd by (x-1,y).  Then in A/p, we have "specialized" the value of x to equal 1 (because we have declared x-1 = 0) but y is still a free variable.  When we pass to the further quotient A/q, we have specialized both x and y: x is specialized to 1 and y is specialized to 0.   At this point, we can't specialize any more; technically, this is because q is a maximal ideal of A,so a closed point of Spec A; intuitively, it is because both x and y have now both been "specialized" to actual numbers, and so we can't specialize any further.But suppose now we set B = Z[x,y], and take p and q to be the same, i.e. gen'd by x-1 and by(x-1,y) respectively.  Then q is not maximal; there is more capacity for specialization.How is this?  Well, x and y are now taking values in Z (rather than the field C) and so we can also reduce both x and y modulo some prime, say 5; this gives a prime ideal r = (x-1,y,5) in B containing q.  Now r is maximal, and so we are done specializing.  So if you have a scheme that is finite type over Z, the closed points will correspond to "actual points", in Kevin's terminology, but defined over finite fields.  The points of the scheme whose coordinates are integers, say, will not be closed.  One has the choice of thinking them of them as "actual points" which nevertheless can be specialized further by reducing modulo primes, or as subvarieties rather than "actual points", by identifying themwith their Zariski closures (for a picture of this, see the drawing of Mumford that Kevin links to).	15
986	980	Intuitively speaking, an open set is a set without a border: every element of the set has, in its neighborhood, other elements of the set. If, starting from a point of the open set, you move away a little, you never exit the set.A closed set is the complement of an open set (i.e. what stays "outside" from the open set).Note that some set exists, that are neither open nor closed.	8
987	980	A set X is open if for every point p in X, there exists a neighborhood (open ball) N of p such that N is a subset of X. We call the point p of the set X a limit point if every neighborhood of p has another point q which is also in X. The set X is closed if every limit point of X is a point of X. A set can be both open and closed, and such sets are occasionally termed "clopen." Trivial examples of clopen sets are the empty set (since it has no points, both the above definitions are vacuously true) and the set of all real numbers. You can in turn visualize an open set in R as an open interval on the real line, and a closed set as a closed interval on the real line.	4

990	980	An open set is a set S for which, given any of its element A, you can find a ball centered in A and whose points are all in S.A closed set is a set S for which, if you have a sequence of points in S who tend to a limit point B, B is also in S.Intuitively, a closed set is a set which contains its own boundary, while an open set is a set where you are able not to leave it if you move just a little bit.	2

1008	996	My answer from the MO thread:A matrix is just a list of numbers, and you're allowed to add and multiply matrices by combining those numbers in a certain way. When you talk about matrices, you're allowed to talk about things like the entry in the 3rd row and 4th column, and so forth. In this setting, matrices are useful for representing things like transition probabilities in a Markov chain, where each entry indicates the probability of transitioning from one state to another. You can do lots of interesting numerical things with matrices, and these interesting numerical things are very important because matrices show up a lot in engineering and the sciences.In linear algebra, however, you instead talk about linear transformations, which are not (I cannot emphasize this enough) a list of numbers, although sometimes it is convenient to use a particular matrix to write down a linear transformation. The difference between a linear transformation and a matrix is not easy to grasp the first time you see it, and most people would be fine with conflating the two points of view. However, when you're given a linear transformation, you're not allowed to ask for things like the entry in its 3rd row and 4th column because questions like these depend on a choice of basis. Instead, you're only allowed to ask for things that don't depend on the basis, such as the rank, the trace, the determinant, or the set of eigenvalues. This point of view may seem unnecessarily restrictive, but it is fundamental to a deeper understanding of pure mathematics.	9
1016	1002	I'll give an engineering answer. If you have a time series that you think is the result of a additive collection of periodic function, the Fourier transform will help you determine what the dominant frequencies are. This is the way guitar tuners work. The perform and FFT on the sound data and pick out the frequency with the greatest power (squares of the real and imaginary parts) and consider that the "note." This is called the fundamental frequency.There are many other uses, so you might want to add big list as a tag.	16

1019	1002	You could think of a Fourier series expanding a function as a sum of sines and cosines analogous to the way a Taylor series expands a function as a sum of powers.Or you could think of the Fourier series as a change of variables.  A fundamental skill in engineering and physics is to pick the coordinate system that makes your problem simplest.  Since the derivatives of sines and cosines are more sines and cosines, Fourier series are the right "coordinate system" for many problems involving derivatives.	11

1025	Usefulness of Conic Sections	Conic sections are a frequent target for dropping when attempting to make room for other topics in advanced algebra and precalculus courses.  A common argument in favor of dropping them is that typical first-year calculus doesn't use conic sections at all.  Do conic sections come up in typical intro-level undergraduate courses?  In typical prelim grad-level courses?  If so, where?	6

1027	1025	Conic sections are basic examples in algebraic geometry, since they are (the real forms of) curves of genus zero.  As such, they are also basic examples in number theory, since it is easy to determine the rational points on a conic section, and this is a good warm-up for studying more complicated Diophantine equations.  In fact, curves of genus zero are the only class of variety for which an algorithm provably exists to determine the rational points!  Even for the next hardest case, elliptic curves, there are no algorithms which provably always work.A great survey of these topics is Bjorn Poonen's Computing rational points on curves.Edit:  There is also Franz Lemmermeyer's Conics - a poor man's elliptic curves, which explains how certain conics can be thought of as "degenerate" elliptic curves.	6

1031	544	Markov chains are used in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).  This computational technique is extremely common in Bayesian statistics.  In Bayesian statistics, you want to compute properties of a posterior distribution.  You'd like to draw independent samples from this distribution, but often this is impractical.  So you construct a Markov chain that has as its limiting distribution the the distribution you want.  So, for example, to get the mean of your posterior distribution you could take the mean of the states of your Markov chain.  (Ergodic theory blesses this process.)	3
1032	668	You could think of a determinant as a volume.  Think of the columns of the matrix as vectors at the origin forming the edges of a skewed box.  The determinant gives the volume of that box.  For example, in 2 dimensions, the columns of the matrix are the edges of a rhombus.You can derive the algebraic properties from this geometrical interpretation.  For example, if two of the columns are linearly dependent, your box is missing a dimension and so it's been flattened to have zero volume.	150

1037	Why are derivatives specified as d/dx?	Is the purpose of the derivative notation d/dx strictly for symbolic manipulation purposes?I remember being confused when I first saw the notation for derivatives - it looks vaguely like there's some division going on and there are some fancy 'd' characters that are added in... I recall thinking that it was a lot of characters to represent an action with respect to one variable. Of course, once you start moving the dx around it makes a little more sense as to why they exist - but is this the only reason?Any history lesson or examples  where this notation is helpful or unhelpful is appreciated.	15
1038	1037	If you have access to it, the book A History of Mathematical Notations, by Florian Cajori, has a pretty detailed description of the history of notations for derivatives in its second volume.	11

1040	1002	A more complicated answer (yet it's going to be imprecise, because I haven't touched this in 15 years...) is the following.In a 3-dimentional space (for example) you can represent a vector v by its end point coordinates, x, y, z, in a very simple way. You choose three vectors which are of unit length and orthogonal with each other (a base), say i, j and k, and calculate the coordinates as such:x = v ∙ iy = v ∙ jz = v ∙ kIn multidimentional space, the equations still hold. In a discrete infinite space, the coordinates and the base vectors become a sequence. The dot product becomes an infinite sum. In a continuous infinite space (like the space of good functions) the coordinates and the bases become functions and the dot product an infinite integral.Now, the Fourier transform is exactly this kind of operation (based on a set of base functions which are basically a set of sines and cosines). In other words, it is a different representation of the same function in relation to a particular set of base functions.As a consequence, for example, functions of time, represented against functions of time and space (in other words integrated over time multiplied by functions of space and time), become functions of space, and so on.Hope it helps!	1
1041	998	Algebraic Geometry: A First Course by Joe Harris is a very good book that sits in that region between undergraduate treatments and the prerequisites of Hartshorne. In particular, one does not need to know much commutative algebra to get a lot out of Harris's book. Harris himself recommends reading Hartshorne after his book for the theory of schemes.	16
1042	980	I will not reiterate the very nice definitions found in the other answers, however I think that these "practical" definitions might help you as well on an intuitive level.Open sets are typically used as domains for functions, as they are more useful for analysing "continuous" properties like differentiability. Also they don't have nasty borders (hence you don't have to deal with functions which are well behaved only on one side of the edge).Closed sets are useful because, if they are limited, they are compact.	1

1045	How do I convert from Cartesian to conical coordinates?	I have some polygons I would like to map onto the face of a cone.I can see from this page that I can convert  the points of the polygon to cylindrical coordinates, which is almost what I want.How do I go about modifying the formulas to work for conical coordinates?	2
1046	1037	If you're a physics kind of person, then a good reason to like this notation is that it gives the correct units for the derivative: whatever units $f(x)$ is in, the units for $\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$ are obtained by dividing by the units for $x$.  	8
1047	1037	Because of their definition:Start with a function, calculate the difference in value between two points and divide by the size of the interval between the two. You can represent this as such:$$\frac{f\left(x_2\right)-f\left(x_1\right)}{x_2-x_1}$$or$$\frac{\Delta f\left(x\right)}{\Delta x}$$ Where ∆, delta, is the Greek capital D and indicates an interval. Now, take the limit as $\Delta x$ goes to zero, and you have the differential. This is indicated by using a lower case $d$ instead of the $\Delta$.$$\frac{df\left(x\right)}{dx}$$Now, if this operation is treated as an operator applied to a function, it is usually represented as$$\frac{d}{dx}f\left(x\right)$$Note that (typically in physics), you can also use the letter $\delta$ to indicate very small intervals and in general you would use the symbol $\partial $ to represent partial differentials. They are all variations of the letter $D$.	24
1048	Different definitions of trigonometric functions	In school, we learn that sin is "opposite over hypotenuse" and cos is "adjacent over hypotenuse".Later on, we learn the power series definitions of sin and cos.How can one prove that these two definitions are equivalent?	14

1050	687	The form this question is usually asked is whether adding a route can increase the average traveling time, and this is known as Braess's paradox.  The Wiki article gives an explicit example in which the travel time on some of the routes depends on the traffic.	2
1051	1025	If you're a physics sort of person, conic sections clearly come up when you study how Kepler figured out what the shapes of orbits are, and some of their synthetic properties give useful shortcuts to things like proving "equal area swept out in equal time" that need not involve calculus.The other skills you typically learn while studying conic sections in analytic geometry - polar parametrization of curves, basic facts about various invariants related to triangles and conics, rotations and changing coordinate systems (so as to recognize the equation of a conic in general form as some sort of transformation of a standard done), are all extremely useful in physics. I'd say that plane analytic geometry was the single most useful math tool for me in solving physics problems until I got to fluid dynamics stuff (where that is replaced by complex analysis).Relatedly, independent of their use in physics, I think they're a great way to show the connections between analytic and synthetic thinking in math, which will come up over and over again for people who go on to study math (coordinate-based versus intrinsic perspectives, respectively).	5
1052	1048	Most of the proofs in elementary calculus textbooks use the definition of $\sin x$ via geometry to prove that the derivative of $\sin x$ is $\cos x$ (namely, the fact that $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{ \sin x}{x} = 1$). Consequently, it follows that $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ are the two linearly independent solutions of $y'' = -y$.  The power series equations are also two linearly independent solutions of this differential equation.  Moreover, $\sin x$ and its derivative coincide with the derivative of the power series for $ \sin x$ at zero (no surprise, it's a Taylor series).  Same for $\cos x$. By uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations, this proves that $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ as defined in school are equal to their power series.  (This is an expansion of Qiaochu's comment.)	11
1053	1048	As a rough outline, the circular definitions of sine and cosine (the y- and x-coordinates of the image of (1,0) under a rotation about the origin) lead to being able to differentiate sine and cosine, and once you know how to differentiate them (infinitely), Taylor's Theorem justifies that the power series is equal to the function.	1
1054	1002	Let me partially steal from the accepted answer on MO, and illustrate it with examples I understand:The Fourier transform is a different representation that makes convolutions easy.Or, to quote directly from there: "the Fourier transform is a unitary change of basis for functions (or distributions) that diagonalizes all convolution operators." This often involves expressing an arbitrary function as a superposition of "symmetric" functions of some sort, say functions of the form eitx — in the common signal-processing applications, an arbitrary "signal" is decomposed as a superposition of "waves" (or "frequencies").Example 1: Polynomial multiplicationThis is the use of the discrete Fourier transform I'm most familiar with. Suppose you want to multiply two polynomials of degree n, given by their coefficients (a0, …, an) and (b0, …, bn). In their product, the coefficient of xk is ck = ∑aibk-i. This is a convolution, and doing it naively would take O(n2) time.Instead, suppose we represent the polynomials by their values at 2n points. Then the value of the product polynomial (the one we want) at any point is simply the product of the values of our original two polynomials. Thus we have reduced convolution to pointwise multiplication. The Fourier transform and its inverse correspond to polynomial evaluation and interpolation respectively, for certain well-chosen points (roots of unity). The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a way of doing both of these in O(n log n) time.Example 2: Convolution of probability distributionsSuppose we have two independent (continuous) random variables X and Y, with probability densities f and g respectively. In other words, P(X ≤ x) = ∫x-∞ f(t)dt and P(Y ≤ y) = ∫y-∞ f(t)dt. We often want the distribution of their sum X+Y, and this is given by a convolution: P(X+Y ≤ z) = ∫f(t)g(z-t)dt. This integration may be hard. But instead of representing the random variables by their densities, we can also represent them by their characteristic functions φX(t) =  E[eitX] and φY(t) = E[eitY]. Then the characteristic function of X+Y is just:φX+Y(t) = E[eit(X+Y)] = φX(t)φY(t) since they're independent. The characteristic function is the continuous Fourier transform of the density function; it is a change of representation in which convolution becomes pointwise multiplication.To quote again the answer on MO, many transformations we want to study (translation, differentiation, integration, …) are actually convolutions, so the Fourier transform helps in a wide number of instances. 	40
1055	1045	Presumably you already have the formulas for converting from conical to rectangular coordinates as listed on the Wikipedia page for conical coordinates. You'll need to solve for r, μ, and ν in terms of x, y, and z to get your answer. I can't see offhand the easiest way to find a general formula, but if you're trying to find it for particular values of r, μ, and ν, it shouldn't be too hard.	2
1056	1048	Call the highschool functions (defined by the right triangle inscribed in a unit circle, the angle being equal to the length of the arc of the circle) $\sin_h$ and $\cos_h$, and let $\sin_p$ and $\cos_p$ be the power series definitions. (Note that these functions are continuous and agree at the end points $0$ and $2\pi$).Since $\sin_p^2(\theta)+\cos_p^2(\theta)=1$ the power series definitions also form a right triangle. Hence $\sin_h = \sin_p \circ \gamma$ and $\cos_h = \cos_p \circ \gamma$ for some parameterization $\gamma$. We know the power series definitions satisfy the arc length criteria so $\gamma$ must be the identity function.	1

Suppose a finite group has the property that for every $x, y$, it follows that \begin{equation*}(xy)^3 = x^3 y^3.\end{equation*}How do you prove that it is abelian?Edit: I recall that the correct exercise needed in addition that the order of the group is not divisible by 3.	5

So there is (as you noticed) a strange gap between reality (epsilonics) and intuition (infinitesimal quantities) but there are a few more recent redevelopments of the foundation of analysis for example Keisler or Bell.	3

1065	1025	Conic sections should definitely be retained. If you don't cover conic sections, then what other examples can you cover?Lines? Too simple. General curves? Insufficiently concrete.Examples are very important for illustrating the general theory and techniques.Also, in a multivariable calculus course, typical examples will involve quadric surfaces. Here conic sections will come into play, since hyperplane sections (or "level curves") of quadric surfaces are conic sections.	2
1066	Packing boxes and proof of Riemann Hypothesis	From Scott Aaronson's blog:  There’s a finite (and not  unimaginably-large) set of boxes, such  that if we knew how to pack those  boxes into the trunk of your car, then  we’d also know a proof of the Riemann  Hypothesis. Indeed, every formal proof  of the Riemann Hypothesis with at most  (say) a million symbols corresponds to  some way of packing the boxes into  your trunk, and vice versa.  Furthermore, a list of the boxes and  their dimensions can be feasibly  written down.His later commented to explain where he get this from: "3-dimensional bin-packing is NP-complete."I don't see how these two are related.Another question inspired by the same article is here.	9
1067	1064	An easy example comes from the fact that a number with an infinite continued fraction expansion is irrational (and conversely). The set of all irrationals with continued fractions consisting only of 1's and 2's in any arrangement is a perfect set of irrational numbers.	37
1068	Usage of dx in Integrals	All the integrals I'm familiar with have the form:  $\int f(x)\mathrm{d}x$.And I understand these as the sum of infinite tiny rectangles with an area of: $f(x_i)\cdot\mathrm{d}x$.Is it valid to have integrals that do not have a differential, such as $\mathrm{d}x$, or that have the differential elsewhere than as a factor ? Let me give couple of examples on what I'm thinking of:  $\int 1$If this is valid notation, I'd expect it to sum infinite ones together, thus to go inifinity.  $\int e^{\mathrm{d}x}$Again, I'd expect this to go to infinity as $e^0 = 1$, assuming the notation is valid.  $\int (e^{\mathrm{d}x} - 1)$This I could potentially imagine to have a finite value.Are any such integrals valid? If so, are there any interesting / enlightening examples of such integrals?	15
1069	Intuitive explanation of covariant, contravariant and Lie derivatives	I would be glad if someone could explain in intuitive terms what these different derivatives are, and possibly give some practical, understandable examples of how they would produce different results.To be clear, I would like to understand the geometrical or physical meaning of these operators more than the mathematical or topological subtleties that lead to them!Thanks!	19
1070	1068	When you write $\int f(x) dx$, the whole of $\int ... dx$ is an indivisible symbol, just as the $d/dx$ is an indivisible symbol when you write $df/dx$.Of course, there are reasons why the notation is as it is, but trying to manipulate it like you suggest in $\int e^{dx}$, for example, is simply meaningless. 	12
1071	1066	The question of whether a formal proof of the Riemann Hypothesis exists (with at most a million symbols) is a problem in NP: given such a proof, it can be verified to be correct in polynomial time.Bin-packing is NP-complete: this means that every problem in NP can be reduced to bin packing. In particular, the problem mentioned in the previous paragraph can. (This is a reduction that can be made explicit, so once we specify the proof verifier etc., we can carry out the steps of the reduction to get an instance of bin packing. We also need the reduction to be "parsimonious" i.e. solutions correspond one-to-one; I believe it is.)	8
1072	1068	No, it's not valid. The dx in the integral is a representation of the fact that the integral is obtained as an area, so multiplying the "average" of the function value at each point by an infinitesimal interval.As the manner in which we don't calculate the area does not change, the notation does not change.There are different notations that are used when the integral is over a curve, or over more than variable (thus leading for example to volumes).The d(variable) notation is also used as a reminder that the integral is against a specific variable and not another, e.g. that int x/y dx differs from int x/y dy.	1
1073	381	It is useful when making estimates (for examples for programming tasks) as $$\forall n \gt 1 \in \mathbb N, F_{n+1} \ne \frac{F_{n+2} + F_n}{2}$$and therefore it discourages bad practices like assuming that two equal-sized tasks necessarily take twice as much as one of them (it's false because the larger the scope, the less accurate the estimate).Example	1
1074	1069	The Lie derivative is a derivative of a vector field V along another vector field W.  It is defined at a point p as follows: flow the point p along W for some time t and look at the value of V at this point.  Then push this forward along the flow of W to a vector at p.  Subtract $V_p$ from this, divide by t, and take the limit as $t \to 0$.  So this is a measure of how V changes as it gets pushed around by the flow of W.The covariant derivative is a derivative of a vector field V along a vector W.  Unlike the Lie derivative, this does not come for free: we need a connection, which is a way of identifying tangent spaces.  The reason we need this extra data is because if we wanted to take the directional derivative of V along the vector W how we do in Euclidean space, we would be taking something like $V_{p+tW} - V_p$, which is the difference of vectors living in different tangent spaces.  If we have a metric, then we can impose reasonable conditions that give us a unique connection (the Levi-Civita connection). I have no idea what a contravariant derivative is.  I'd guess it has to do with applying a covariant derivative and lowering indices.	13
1075	1068	I think your question here shows that, while you have been using these symbols, you haven't really been given a proper motivation for where they came from.Let's go back and consider how we came up with the idea of an integral. In a typical class, you will see a lot of pictures like this:We find the area under the curve by summing up the area of all these little rectangles. If we wanted to write an expression for the area, it would look like:alt text http://mathurl.com/27gla3n.pngThe Σ means that we are computing a sum. We are adding the areas of the rectangles, which we have numbered 1 through n, to get the complete area under the curve. The area of each rectangle is given by multiplying the height by the width. The height is given by f(xi) because the base of the rectangle is at 0, and the top of the rectangle is where it meets the function f. The Δx represents the width of each rectangle.When we find the integral, we are taking the limit of this sum as the number of rectangles goes to infinity, and each individual rectangle becomes infinitesimally tiny. You can think of the dx as the equivalent of Δx: it represents the infinitesimally small width of each rectangle that we added up to get the area.  Once you realize this, we can see why integrals only make sense when written ∫f(x)dx. Because we are adding up the areas of rectangles that have height f(x) and width dx. If you try to interpret the expressions you wrote in this way, you will see that they do not really make sense as integrals: you are not summing up rectangles, so you are not finding an area under a curve.  You could, of course, define your own notation in which those expressions behave the way you expect them to, but all mathematical notation is driven based on what people find useful, and what people can agree on and easily understand. Your reuse of the integral sign and dx that people are used to seeing in a particular context will probably result in few people adopting your definition.	21
1076	1048	There is another proof that the derivative of sine is cosine that doesn't use the sandwich theorem mentioned by Qiaochu and Akhil above.  Instead, one can use the definition of arcsine and the standard calculus formula for arc length in terms of an integral to show that arcsine = the integral of (1 - x^2)^(-.5).  It follows that the derivative of arcsine is (1 - x^2)^(-.5), and (by the chain rule) one can use this fact to prove that the derivative of sine is cosine.In fact, I'm not sure why this proof is presented less frequently then the one via the sandwich theorem.  The unit circle definition of sine is based on arc length, and in calculus we learn a formula for arc length based on integration.  Why not connect these two concepts for a natural proof that the derivative of sine is cosine?	5
1077	713	One way to "visualize" a 2-tensor (in the presence of an inner product) is as follows: a vector $X$ can be regarded as a function mapping each direction $D$ to a scalar in a linear and homogeneous fashion, namely, the inner product $X\dot D$. In the same vein, a 2-tensor is a function mapping directions to vectors linearly and homogeneously.	0
1078	946	1) Why does a small number of states suffice?Regardless of whether the constant is 5 or 500, its still very surprising. Thankfully, it's fairly straightforward to prove this if you allow the counter to be $\{1, \ldots, 8\}$ instead of $\{1, \ldots, 5\}$. [This proof is by Ben-Or and Cleve.]. Start by representing the computation as a circuit, and ignore the whole wiping-clean thing.Define a register machine as follows: It has 3 registers $(R_1,R_2,R_3)$, each of which holds a single bit. At each step, the program performs some computation on the registers of the form $R_i \gets R_a + x_b R_c$ or $R_i \gets R_a + x_b R_c + R_d$ (where $x_1\ \ldots x_n$ is the input).Initially, set $(R_1,R_2,R_3) = (1,0,0)$. The machine should end in the state $R_3 + f R_1$. We'll simulate the circuit using a register machine.We now proceed by induction on the depth of the circuit. If the circuit has depth 0, then we just copy the appropriate bit: $R_3 \gets R_3 + x_i R_1$.For the induction, we have 3 cases, according to whether the final gate is NOT, AND, or OR.Suppose that the circuit is $\neg f$. By induction, we can compute $f$, yielding the state $(R_1,R_2,R_3 + f R_1)$. We can therefore perform the instruction $R_3 \gets R_3 + R_1$ to get the desired output.If the circuit is $f_1 \wedge f_2$, then life is a tad more complicated. By induction, we then execute the following 4 instructions:\begin{align*}R_2 &\gets R_2 + f_1 R_1 \\R_3 &\gets R_3 + f_2 R_2 \\R_2 &\gets R_2 + f_1 R_1 \\R_3 &\gets R_3 + f_2 R_2\end{align*}Assuming I haven't made any typos, we are left with the state $(R_1,R_2,R_3+f_1f_2R_1)$, as desired. $f_1 \vee f_2$ works similarly.QED.Take a moment to process what just happened. It's a slick proof that you have to read 2 or 3 times before it begins to sink in. What we've shown is that we can simulate a circuit by applying a fixed program that stores only 3 bits of information at any time.To convert this into Aaronson's version, we encode the three registers into the counter (that's why we needed the extra 3 spaces). The simple program uses the input and the clock to determine how far we've made it through the computation and then applies the appropriate change to the counter. 2) But what's the deal with 5?To get from 8 states down to 5, you use a similar argument, but are much more careful about exactly how much information needs to be propagated between stages and how it can be encoded. A formal proof requires lots of advanced group theory.Edit to answer Casebash's questions:1) Correct. Any computation can be expressed as a circuit composed solely of "NOT", binary-"AND", and binary-"OR" gates.2) The notation $f R_1$ means (boolean) multiplication.3) The program for computing $f$ should take input $(R_1,R_2,R_3)$ to $(R_1,R_2,R_3 + f R_1)$. We insist that the first two registers are unchanged since we use those as temporary storage in the induction. For example, when computing $f_1 \wedge f_2$, we compute the first branch and store the result in $R_2$ while computing the second branch.4) The single bit of output is the final value of $R_3$. Since we started with $(1,0,0)$, we end with $(1,0,f)$.	17
1079	Sum of two periodic functions	Let $f$ and $g$ be two periodic functions over $\Bbb{R}$ with the following property: If $T$ is a period of $f$, and $S$ is a period of $g$, then $T/S$ is irrational. Conjecture: $f+g$ is not periodic.Could you give a proof or a counter example?  It is easier if we assume continuity.  But is it true for arbitrary real valued functions?	19
1081	1079	Pick a basis $B$ of $\mathbb R$ as a $\mathbb Q$ vector space, and split it into two non-empty disjoint parts $B_1$ and $B_2$. Define $\mathbb Q$-linear maps $f,g:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $f(x)=x$ and $g(x)=0$ if $x\in B_1$, $f(x)=0$ and $g(x)=x$ if $x\in B_2$. Then $f(x)+g(x)=x$ for all $x\in B$, so that in fact $f+g=\operatorname{id}_{\mathbb R}$, which is not a periodic function. Morever $f$ and $g$ are periodic, and their sets of periods are precisely $B_1$ and $B_2$. Since $B_1\cup B_2$ is linearly independent over $\mathbb Q$, it is easy to see that $x/y\not\in\mathbb Q$ whenever $x\in B_1$ and $y\in B_2$.This is then an example where the sum is not periodic.	3
1083	1079	Here is a counterexample.  Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$ be linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$.  Let $\text{span}(x, y, z, ...)$ be the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space in $\mathbb{R}$ spanned by $x, y, z, ...$.  Let $AB = \text{span}(a, b), BC = \text{span}(b, c), AC = \text{span}(a, c)$.  And for a subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$, let $\chi_S$ denote the characteristic function of $S$.  Now define$\displaystyle f(x) = \chi_{AB} - 2 \chi_{BC}$and$\displaystyle g(x) = 3 \chi_{AC} + 2 \chi_{BC}.$Then $f$ has period set $\text{span}(b)$, $g$ has period set $\text{span}(c)$, and $f + g$ has period set $\text{span}(a)$.  (I am not sure if the coefficients are necessary; they're just precautions.)Are you still interested in the continuous case?(Old answer below.  I slightly misunderstood the question when I wrote this.)Here is a simpler example.  I claim that the function $h(x) = \sin x + \sin \pi x$ cannot possibly be periodic.  Why?  Suppose an equation of the form$\sin x + \sin \pi x = \sin (x+T) + \sin \pi (x+T)$held for all $x$ and some $T > 0$.  Take the second derivative of both sides with respect to $x$ to get$\sin x + \pi^2 \sin \pi x = \sin (x+T) + \pi^2 \sin \pi(x+T).$This implies that $\sin x = \sin (x+T)$ and that $\sin \pi x = \sin \pi(x+T)$, which is impossible.(Or is the question whether the sum can be periodic?)	18
1084	668	The top exterior power of an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ is one-dimensional. Its elements are sometimes called pseudoscalars, and they represent oriented $n$-dimensional volume elements.A linear operator $f$ on $V$ can be extended to a linear map on the exterior algebra according to the rules $f(\alpha) = \alpha$ for $\alpha$ a scalar and $f(A \wedge B) = f(A) \wedge f(B), f(A + B) = f(A) + f(B)$ for $A$ and $B$ blades of arbitrary grade. Trivia: some authors call this extension an outermorphism. The extended map will be grade-preserving; that is, if $A$ is a homogeneous element of the exterior algebra of grade $m$, then $f(A)$ will also have grade $m$. (This can be verified from the properties of the extended map I just listed.)All this implies that a linear map on the exterior algebra of $V$ once restricted to the top exterior power reduces to multiplication by a constant: the determinant of the original linear transformation. Since pseudoscalars represent oriented volume elements, this means that the determinant is precisely the factor by which the map scales oriented volumes.	22
1085	998	Before Hartshorne's book there was Mumford's Red Book of Varieties.  I think it is a great introductory textbook to modern algebraic geometry (scheme theory).I found that Mumford is quite good at motivating new concepts; in particular I really enjoy his development of nonsingularity and the sheaf of differentials.  I think another great aspect about this book is that it emphasizes how to define things intrinsically (i.e. without reference to a closed or open immersion into affine space) but also explains how to make local arguments (i.e. using immersion into affine space).  A classic example of the above:(non intrinsic tangent space): Say X is a variety and p is a point of X.  Choose an affine neighborhood so that p corresponds to the origin.  Then this affine neighborhood is spec k[x1, ..., xn]/I for some ideal.  Let I' be all the linear terms of I (i.e. if I = (x,y^2), then I' = (x)).  Then the tangent space at p is spec k[x1,...,xn]/I'.(intrinsic tangent space): Let m be the maximal ideal of the local ring of the structure sheaf at p, then the tangent space is the dual of the vector space m/m^2.Taking spec of the symmetric algebra of the latter gives you the former.Some drawbacks.  This book doesn't cover nearly as much as Hartshorne's book.  It doesn't have that many exercises.  The notation is slightly different; integral finite type schemes are called pre-varieties and you can remove the `pre' if it's also separated.  Nevertheless I think its a great compliment to reading Hartshorne.	11
1086	998	Another book I wish I had known about when I was first reading Hartshorne is Miranda's Complex Algebraic Curves.Again this book covers much less then Hartshorne and only discusses curves over the complex numbers (and their Jacobians).  But it gives a lot more details and examples of concepts which I found particularly difficult when I first started learning algebraic geometry (sheafs, divisors, cohomology).  It also has a bunch of exercises which I think are often not as challenging as the the exercises in Hartshorne.   It also covers a lot more of the 'classical' theory of curves than Hartshrone does; e.g. Weierstrass points. 	3
1087	381	They're a much easier way to evaluate the function$f(x) = \dfrac{\varphi^x -(-\varphi)^x}{\sqrt{5}}$by hand, where $\varphi$ is the golden ratio and $x$ is an integer :)	-1
1088	998	My last suggestion would be Ravi Vakil's online notes on the foundations of algebraic geometry.I think these notes might be made into a full on textbook someday.  I haven't looked through all of them but these notes seem to cover as much as Hartshorne does (if not more).  Only rarely do Hartshorne and Vakil define things differently (`projective morphisms' is the only example that comes to mind).I've heard it said that Hartshorne's book is a `baby' version of EGA.  I think Vakil's notes are somewhere between Hartshorne and EGA (probably not the midpoint though).  At least Vakil discusses much more the theory of representable functors, and Noetherian hypothesis are less prevalent in Vakil's notes.  Also Vakil's notes are more complete in that they also include proofs of many of the commutative algebra results that are just stated in Hartshorne.I think Vakil spends a lot more time motivating the material and often the notes are a bit conversational.  Also there are tons of exercises and most of the them are appended with useful qualifiers like (easy but important exercises, unimportant exercise, tedious but useful exercise, etc).One drawback is that they are very long and they are online notes so there are many typos.  But most of them are grammatical and easy to spot.[Edit: By now there are only a few typos (because these are online notes)] 	28
1090	250	For any five points on the globe, there is an angle in outer space from which you could see at least 4 of the 5 points (assuming the moon or anything isn't in the way).  The proof is pretty simple, too...	11
1091	Is there a geometrical interpretation to the notion of eigenvector and eigenvalues?	The wiki article on eigenvectors offers the following geometrical interpretation:  Each application of the matrix to an arbitrary vector yields a result which will have rotated towards the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.Qn 1: If there is any other geometrical interpretation particularly in the context of a covariance matrix?The wiki also discusses the difference between left and right eigenvectors.Qn 2: Do the above geometrical interpretations hold irrespective of whether they are left or right eigenvectors?	10
1092	1091	Of course! Consider a coordinate transformation of rotation and/or scaling (but not translation):v = Auwhere v and u are vectors, and A is a transformation matrix. Then the eigenvectors, if they have real components, are the axes which are left unrotated (scaling only) by the transformation. (see wikipedia)A covariance matrix is a symmetric, positive definite matrix, so it has orthonormal eigenvectors, and these form a tuple of axes; I am fairly sure the eigenvectors form a new basis of linear combinations of the input variables where the basis variables are uncorrelated, but I can't remember how to show this.For example, if w1 = [x;y] is a pair of independent unit-variance zero-mean Gaussian random variables, consider w2 = [u;v] = [1 1; 2 1][x;y] = (x+y,2x+y), so that w1 = [-1 1;2 -1][u;v] = [v-u;2u-v]. Then cov(w2) = [2 3; 3 5]. This has eigenvectors which have sqrt(5) in them, hmmmm...As for question 2, I'm not sure.	2
1093	392	Perhaps the following diagram will provide insight:The idea is to look at the sine and cosine curves as projections of a helix drawn on a cylinder. If you look at the cylinder itself as a curled planar square of length 2pi, then helix is a curled version of the square's diagonal. A tangent vector along the flat square's diagonal always lies at 45 degrees to the square's sides, say with length-"1" shadows in each direction; after smoothly curling the square into the cylinder, the tangent vector lies at 45 degrees to the cylinder's (z-)axis and the perpendicular (xy-)plane. Projecting the helix into the zy- and zx-planes gives graphs of sine and cosine. Projecting the helix's tangent vector gives tangent vectors to those graphs. The "dz"s for these projected tangents are always 1 (the "vertical" shadow of the helix's tangent vector). To get at "dy" and "dx" ("v_x" and "v_y" in the diagram) we project down into the xy-plane where we see a circle, and yet another projected tangent vector.Basic geometry tells us that a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. In our circle, the point of tangency --and the radius vector it-- is parameterized as "< cos, sin, 0 >". The perpendicular tangent line must therefore have a "negative-reciprocal" direction vector: "< -sin, cos, 0 >", which gives us our "dx" and "dy" for the helix tangent ... and the projected graph tangents as well, so that we may make the following conclusions:The derivative of cosine --by its conceptual definition as "slope of the tangent line"-- is change-in-x-over-change-in-z = dx/dz = -sin/1 = -sin.Likewise, the derivative of sine is dy/dz = cos/1 = cos.I like this approach because the conceptual "slope of tangent line" definition of the derivative is used throughout; there are no (obvious) appeals to digressive computational tricks involving trig identities and limits of difference quotients. I also like that the curious negative sign in the derivative of cosine traces back to an elementary property of circle geometry.Of course, this approach doesn't constitute proof of the formulas. The process of curling the planar square into a cylinder and claiming that the tangent vector behaves as claimed actually assumes the computational machinery covered by the traditional limit arguments. Nevertheless, on an intuitive level, I think this argument explains the "why" of the derivatives quite beautifully. Then, knowing what the formulas are (or "should be") helps motivate the investigation of the computational tricks needed to provide a rigorous proof.Here's a PDF with a variant of the above discussion (but the same image). Here's a Mathematica Demonstration that animates the various elements, including the square curling into the cylinder.	41
1094	998	for Undergraduate algebraic geometry (significantly below the level of Hartshorne), Cox, Little and O'Shea's Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms is a pleasant treatment.	10
1095	1091	Here is a partial answer in the case where M is a real symmetric matrix.  This is to ensure, by the real spectral theorem, that M has real eigenvectors with real eigenvalues, so there is a chance for a genuine geometric interpretation which stays in $R^n$.M acts on the unit sphere in $R^n$ in the following way: it sends the unit sphere $v^T v = 1$ to $v^T (M^T M) v = 1$ .  This modified shape is not generally a sphere, but is generally an ellipsoid.  The axes of this ellipsoid are the eigenvectors of M, and the sizes of each axis are given by the squares of the corresponding eigenvalues.	11
1096	Where is the flaw in this "proof" that 1=2? (Derivative of repeated addition)	Consider the following:$1 = 1^2$$2 + 2 = 2^2$$3 + 3 + 3 = 3^2$Therefore,$\underbrace{x + x + x + \ldots + x}_{x \textrm{ times}}= x^2$Take the derivative of lhs and rhs and we get:$\underbrace{1 + 1 + 1 + \ldots + 1}_{x \textrm{ times}} = 2x$Which simplifies to:$x = 2x$and hence $1 = 2$.Clearly something is wrong but I am unable pinpoint my mistake.	49
1097	1096	You cannot take the derivative with respect to x of x + x + x + ... (repeated x times) one term at a time because the number of terms depends on x.Even beyond that, if you can express x2 as x + x + x + ... (repeated x times), then x must be an integer and if the domain of the expression is the integers, (continuous) differentiation does not make sense and/or the derivatives do not exist.(edit: I gave my first reason first because the second reason can be smoothed over by taking "repeated x times" to mean something like $\underset{\lfloor x\rfloor\mathrm{\ addends}}{\underbrace{x+x+\cdots+x}}+(x-\lfloor x\rfloor)\cdot x$.)	50
1098	1096	You cannot differentiate the LHS of your equation  x + x + x + ... (repeated x times) = x^2This is because the LHS is not a continuous function; the number of terms depends on x so the LHS is not well defined when x is not an integer. We can only differentiate continuous functions, so this is not valid.	8
1099	Mandelbrot-like sets for functions other than $f(z)=z^2+c$?	Are there any well-studied analogs to the Mandelbrot set using functions other than $f(z)= z^2+c$ in $\mathbb{C}$?	23
1100	381	How many ways are there to tile a $2 \times n$ grid with $1 \times 2$ dominos? This problem can be solved using Fibonacci numbers. Let Sn be the number of valid tilings of the 2 x n grid. Each such tiling has either a vertical 1 x 2 domino or two horizontal dominos on the right. Therefore, each tiling of a 2 x (n-1) grid or a 2 x (n-2) grid generates a tiling of the 2 x n grid, and hence we have a recurrence relation Sn = Sn-1 + Sn-2. This is precisely the recurrence relation of the Fibonacci numbers. Checking our base cases, we see that there is one way to tile a 1 x 2 grid and two ways to tile a 2 x 2 grid, so S1 = 1 and S2 = 2. Therefore, the number of tilings is precisely the Fibonacci sequence.	8
1101	514	Another example: Euler's sum of powers conjecture, a generalization of Fermat's Last Theorem. It states:If the equation $\sum_{i=1}^kx_i^n=z^n$ has a solution in positive integers, then n ≤ k (unless k=1). Fermat's Last Theorem is the k=2 case of this conjecture.A counterexample for n = 5 was found in 1966: it's$$61917364224=27^5+84^5+110^5+133^5=144^5$$The smallest counterexample for n = 4 was found in 1988:$$31858749840007945920321 = 95800^4+217519^4+414560^4=422481^4$$This example used to be even more useful in the days before FLT was proved, as an answer to the question "Why do we need to prove FLT if it has been verified for thousands of numbers?" :-)	60
1102	1099	There is the Julia set, which can be defined for any complex rational map f(z) = P(z)/Q(z) where P(z) and Q(z) are polynomials. The Julia set for the map fc(z) = z^2 + c is related to the Mandelbrot set in that a point z is in the Mandelbrot set if the Julia set of fc(z) is connected.	5
1103	1048	If you allow yourself a tiny bit of calculus ( "$\sin x / x \to 1$" as "$x \to 0$" ) and apply some combinatorics, there's a really nice geometric interpretation of the terms of the power series for the functions. Consider this diagram and the polygonal "spiral" that starts at $P_0$ and closes in on the point $P$ (where $|P_0 P| = 1$).The horizontal segments $P_{2n} P_{2n+1}$ alternately overshoot and undershoot the length of the cosine segment; the vertical segments $P_{2n+1} P_{2n+2}$ do the same for the sine segment. So,   $\cos \theta = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n | P_{2n} P_{2n+1} |$   $\sin \theta = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n | P_{2n+1} P_{2n+2} |$Now, the lengths $|P_{k} P_{k+1}|$ are equal to the lengths of the curves $|I_k|$, which constitute a series of successive involutes (with $I_0$ defined to be a segment, and $I_1$ defined to be an arc of the unit circle). Combinatorics and the calculus result I mentioned show that the involute lengths satisfy ...  $|I_k| = \theta^k / k!$... so that the above are, in fact, power series.Interestingly, the same thing can be done with secant and tangent, using an involute zig-zag:where   $\sec \theta = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} | P_{2n} P_{2n+1} | = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} | I_{2n} |$  $\tan \theta = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} | P_{2n+1} P_{2n+2} | = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} | I_{2n+1} |$and the lengths $|I_k|$ turn out to be the appropriate multiples of powers of $\theta^k$.Reference to the argument for sine and cosine (attributed to Y. S. Chaikovsky, as reported by Leo Gurin), a complete discussion of the trickier argument for secant and tangent, and then a refinement of the argument for sine and cosine, are in my note "Zig-Zag Involutes, Up-Down Permutations, and Secant and Tangent" (PDF).BTW: I have not (yet) cracked the case for cosecant and cotangent.	18
1104	1096	Here's my explanation from an old sci.math post:Zachary Turner  wrote on 26 Jul 2002:  Let D = d/dx = derivative wrt x. ThenD[x^2] = D[x  +   x  + ... +   x  (x times)]       = D[x] + D[x] + ... + D[x] (x times)       =   1  +   1  + ... +   1  (x times)       =   xAn obvious analogous fallacious argument proves both$ $ D[x f(x)]  =  Df(x) (x  times) = x Df(x)$ $ D[x f(x)]  =   Dx (f(x) times) = f(x), via  Dx = 1vs.  the correct result: their sum  $\rm\:f(x) + x\, Df(x)\:$as given by the Leibniz product rule (= chain rule for times).The error arises from overlooking the dependence upon x in botharguments of the product  $\rm\: x \ f(x)\:$  when applying the chain rule.The source of the error becomes clearer if we consider adiscrete analog. This will also eliminate any tangentialconcerns on the meaning of "(x times)" for non-integer x.Namely, we consider the shift operator  $\rm\ S:\, n \to n+1\ $  on polynomials  $\rm\:p(n)\:$ with integer coefficients, where  $\rm\:S p(n) = p(n+1).\:$ Here is a similar fallacy  S[n^2] =  S[n  +   n  + ... +   n  (n times)]         =  S[n] + S[n] + ... + S[n] (n times)         =  1+n  + 1+n  + ... + 1+n  (n times)         = (1+n)nBut correct is  $\rm\ S[n^2] = (n+1)^2.\:$ Here the "product rule" is $\rm\ S[fg] = S[f]\, S[g],\ $ not  $\rm\: S[f] g\:$  as above.The fallacy actually boils down to operator noncommutativity.On the space of functions $\rm\:f(x),\:$ consider "x" as the linearoperator of multiplication by  x, so  $\rm\ x:\, f(x) \to x f(x).\:$ Thenthe linear operators  $\rm\:D\:$  and  $\rm\:x\:$  generate an operator algebra of polynomials  $\rm\:p(x,D)\:$ in NON-commutative indeterminates $\rm\:x,D\:$since we have  (Dx)[f] = D[xf] = xD[f] + f = (xD+1)[f], so  Dx = xD + 1 ≠ xD  (Sn)[f] = S[nf] = (n+1)S[f], so  Sn = (n+1)S ≠ nSThis view reveals the error as mistakenlyassuming commutativity of the operators  $\rm\:x,D\:$  or  $\rm\:n,S.$Perhaps something to ponder on boring commutes !	8
1105	677	I like your problem. But your opposite parity conjecture doesn't seem to handle the case N=3 and S=2 (even when corrected as in Mau's comment by gcd), with a triangle labeled as follows:        1     1     0This position appears to be invariant under any move, so you cannot reach all 0s.More generally, a similar obstacle works for any 3n-gon, with S=2n. If you repeat the pattern 1 1 0 all the way around, it is stable under any move. If $n$ is odd, these will have opposite parities.	1
1106	639	I asked this question on MathOverflow and got a great answer there.For $k = 2$ I can do it with ${\lceil \log_2 N \rceil + 2 \choose 2} - 1$ servants.  In particular for $N = 1000$ I can do it with $65$ servants.  The proof is somewhat long, so I don't want to post it until I've thought about the problem more.I haven't been able to improve on the above result.  Here's how it works.  Let $n = \lceil \log_2 N \rceil$.  Let me go through the algorithm for $k = 1$ so we're all on the same page.  Number the wines and assign each of them the binary expansion of their number, which consists of $n$ bits.  Find $n$ servants, and have servant $i$ drink all the wines whose $i^{th}$ bit is $1$.  Then the set of servants that die tells you the binary expansion of the poisoned wine.For $k = 2$ we need to find $n$ butlers, $n$ maids, and ${n \choose 2}$ cooks.  The cooks will be named $(i, j)$ for some positive integers $1 \le i < j \le n$.  Have butler $i$ drink all the wines whose $i^{th}$ bit is $1$, have maid $i$ drink all the wines whose $i^{th}$ bit is $0$, and have cook $(i, j)$ drink all the wines such that the sum of the $i^{th}$ bit through the $j^{th}$ bit, inclusive, mod 2, is $1$.  This is how the casework breaks down for butlers and maids.If both butler $i$ and maid $i$ die, then one of the poisoned wines has $i^{th}$ bit $0$ and the other has $i^{th}$ bit $1$.If only butler $i$ dies, then both of the poisoned wines have $i^{th}$ bit $1$.If only maid $i$ dies, then both of the poisoned wines have $i^{th}$ bit $0$.The second two cases are great.  The problem with case 1 is that if it occurs more than once, there's still ambiguity about which wine has which bit.  (The worst scenario is if all the butlers and maids die.)  To fix the issue with case 1, we use the cooks.  Let $i_1 < ... < i_m$ be the set of bits where case 1 occurs.  We'll say that the poisoned wine whose $(i_1)^{th}$ bit is $1$ is wine A, and the other one is wine B.  Notice that the sum of the $(i_1)^{th}$ through $(i_2)^{th}$ bits of wine A mod 2 is the same as the sum of the $(i_1)^{th}$ through $(i_2)^{th}$ bits of wine B mod 2, and we can determine what this sum is by looking at whether cook $(i_1, i_2)$ died.  The value of this sum determines whether the $(i_2)^{th}$ bit of wine A is 1 or 0 (and the same for wine B).  Similarly, looking at whether cook $(i_j, i_{j+1})$ died tells us the remaining bits of wine A, hence of wine B.One last comment for now.  The lower bound is not best possible when $k$ is large compared to $N$; for example, when $k = N-1$ it takes $N-1$ servants.  The reason is that any servant who drinks more than one wine automatically dies, hence gives you no information. 	27

1108	Why should one expect valuations to be related to primes? How to treat an infinite place algebraically?	I understand the mechanics of the proof of Ostrowski's Theorem, but I'm a little unclear on why one should expect valuations to be related to primes. Is this a special property of number fields and function fields, or do primes of K[x,y] correspond to valuations on K(x,y) in the same way?I'm hoping for an answer that can explain what exactly are the algebraic analogs of archimedian valuations, and how to use them - for example, I've heard that the infinite place on K(x) corresponds to the "prime (1/x)" - how does one take a polynomial in K[x] "mod (1/x)" rigorously?Thanks in advance.	4
1109	1064	It can be proven that the Cantor set is perfect. Certainly, this contains infinitely many rationals. How about modifying the construction of the Cantor set by defining:$I_1 = [\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}+1/3] \cup [\sqrt{2}+2/3,\sqrt{2}+1]$, $I_2 = [\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}+1/9] \cup [\sqrt{2}+2/9,\sqrt{2}+1/3]\cup[\sqrt{2}+2/3,\sqrt{2}+7/9]\cup[\sqrt{2}+8/9,\sqrt{2}+1]$, etc and setting $P = \cap_{i=1}^\infty I_i$? Each of end points of any interval that appears in the construction is a member of $P$ and is irrational. However, is it true that all the members of $P$ must be an end point of a certain interval? I am tempted to think so because we can prove that $P$ does not contain any interval. 	6
1110	1099	A variant on the M-set can be defined in straightforward fashion for any iterated function in the complex plane parameterized by a single initial value. For instance, slight modifications produce the tricorn and burning ship fractals. However, most such variations tend to be either boring, incoherent, or obviously derived from the Mandelbrot set--nothing particularly novel.Some obvious patterns also emerge quickly from many variations: Real exponents alter symmetry, imaginary exponents cause asymmetric twisting, disreputable functions produce misshapen lumps like the burning ship, and so on.On the other hand, it's more difficult than you might expect to avoid the M-set in the first place: For a well known example, consider the Newton-Raphson method for approximating roots, which can be generalized to the complex plane in straightforward fashion. For some polynomial, a point in the complex plane may or may not converge to a particular root after some number of Newton-Raphson iterations. In most cases, plotting the regions of divergence and convergence per root produces a fractal. Modifying the polynomial and the iteration formula produces effects analogous to modifying the constant and iteration function, respectively, of a standard Julia set, and in fact it turns out that Julia fractals can be considered a special case of Newton-Raphson fractals.Analogous structure can also be found elsewhere than the complex plane. The period-doubling behavior of the logistic map relates to the behavior of points on the real line of the M-set, and islands of stability for the logistic map correspond to the positions of mini-Mandelbrots. Elaborate Julia-like structures can also be found in the quaternions, although unfortunately visualization of 4-dimensional fractals is somewhat challenging.My suspicion is that Julia-like structure will arise for any fractal defined by similar means, e.g., classifying points into sets based on their behavior under repeated iteration of a position-sensitive transformation, but I'm not sure how to define "similar means" precisely enough to formalize that.	16
1111	1091	If you are interested in covariance matrices, then the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix tell you how to change variables to make your random variables uncorrelated. Specifically, let $M$ be a covariance matrix of the random variables $X_1,...,X_n$. For simplicity, lets assume that all of these random variables are zero mean. Lets also define $X$ to be the random vector whose $i$"th component is the random variable $X_i$. Let the eigenvectors of $M$ be $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$. We can assume that these are orthogonal since $M$ is symmetric. Consider the random variables $Y_i$ obtained by taking the dot product of $v_i$ and $X$. Then the random variables $Y_1, ..., Y_n$ are uncorrelated!Indeed:$$ E[ Y_i Y_j] = E[ v_i^T X X^T v_j] = v_i^T M v_j = \lambda_j v_i^T v_j = 0 $$	5
1112	941	While it is certainly true that with the proper definition there is now 'wrong' notation, perhaps it should be mentioned that some notation is more suggestive and/or easier to work with than others, e.g. Arabic numeral vs. Roman numerals, the various symbols for the derivative, and countless others. The actual symbols are arbitrary, but good notation can certainly promote the flow of ideas more easily. Also, do I remember correctly that Feynman gave up trying to invent more efficient notation for simple math when he was quite young because nobody could understand what he was doing?A good notation has a subtlety and suggestiveness which at times make it almost seem like a live teacher.    --Bertrand Russell	5
1113	Nonprimes with $3^{n-1} \equiv 2^{n-1} \pmod n$	Is it true that there are infinitely many nonprime integers $n$ such that $3^{n-1} - 2^{n-1}$ is a multiple of $n$?	4
1114	1108	I couldn't divine much information on your background (e.g. undergraduate, master's level, PhD student...) from the question, but I recently taught an intermediate level graduate course which had a unit on valuation theory.  Sections 1.6 through 1.8 ofhttp://math.uga.edu/~pete/8410Chapter1.pdfaddress your questions.  In particular, if your field $K$ is the fraction field of a Dedekind domain $R$, then you can always use each prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $R$ to define a valuation on $K$, essentially the "order at $\mathfrak{p}$".  There is also a converse result, Theorem 13: if you have a valuation on $K$ which has the additional property that it is non-negative at every element of the Dedekind domain $R$, then it has to be (up to equivalence) the $\mathfrak{p}$-adic valuation for some $\mathfrak{p}$.   I felt the need to give this additional condition a name, so I called such a valuation R-regular.The point is that (as Qiaochu says in his comments), in case $K$ is a number field and $R$ is its ring of integers, every valuation on $K$ is $R$-regular.  However, in the function field setting this is not true and this leads to a discussion of "infinite places".  Note that I do describe the analogues of Ostrowski's Theorem for finite extensions both of $\mathbb{Q}$ and of $F(t)$ for any field $F$ (in the latter case, one restricts to valuations which are trivial on $F$; when $F$ is finite, this condition is automatic).  I would be interested to know whether you find the notes helpful.  If not, I or someone else can probably recommend an alternative reference.    	2
1115	1108	Discrete valuations <-> points on a curveFor a nonsingular projective curve over an algebraically closed field, there is a one-one correspondence between the points on it, and the discrete valuations of the function field (i.e. all the meromorphic functions of the curve). The correspondence is point P -> the valuation that sends a function f, to the order of zero/pole of f at P.Maximal ideals <-> points on a curveAt least for varieties (common zeros of several polynomials) over an algebraically closed field, there is a one-one correspondence between points on it, and the maximal ideal in $k[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$. The correspondence is point $P = (a_1,\cdots,a_n)$ -> the polynomials vanishing at P, which turns out to be $(x_1-a_1,\cdots,x_n-a_n)$. This is something true not only for curves, but for varieties. (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz) So putting these together, for nonsingular projective curves over an algebraically closed field, you know that there is a one-one correspondence between the maximal ideals (think them as points) and the discrete valuations of the function field. Now the situation here is analogous. You consider a "curve", whose coordinate ring is $\mathbb{Z}$, with function field $\mathbb{Q}$. The nonarchimedean valuations correspond to discrete valuations in this case. So they should capture order of zeros/poles at some "points". What are the points? They should correspond to the maximal ideals of $\mathbb{Z}$, which are exactly the primes here.As for $K(x)$, look at it as the function field of $K\mathbb{P}^1$. Just like the usual real/complex projective spaces, you should have two pieces here. Let's say $K[x]$ corresponds to the piece where the second coordinate is nonzero. So the corresponding homogeneous coordinates here is like $[x,1]$. We know there is one point missing, which is $[1,0]$. For this, we change our coordinates $[x,1] \to [1,1/x]$, so the piece where the first coordinate is nonzero should be $K[1/x]$. The missing point corresponds to the ideal $(1/x - 0) = (1/x)$, so this is why the infinite place corresponds to (1/x). Of course, a more straight forward interpretation is that for a rational function, you divide both numerator and denominator sufficiently high power of $x$ so that they both become polynomials in 1/x, have nonzero constant term, with an extra term (x to the some power). The infinite place measures this power.	2
1116	Number of ways to partition a rectangle into n sub-rectangles	How many ways can a rectangle be partitioned by either vertical or horizontal lines into n sub-rectangles? At first I thought it would be:      f(n) = 4f(n-1) - 2f(n-2)  where f(0) = 1    and f(1) = 1 but the recurrence relation only counts the cases in which at least one side (either top, bottom, left or right of the original rectangle) is not split into sub-rectangles. There are many other partitions that don't belong to those simple cases like[EDIT ImageShack has removed the picture. One of the cases is the sixth partition when n = 4 in the picture in the accepted answer below.]Any other related problem suggestions are welcome. Also it is nice to know how to traverse this partition efficiently.	19

1118	Characterising functions $f$ that can be written as $f = g \circ g$?	I'd like to characterise the functions that ‘have square roots’ in the function composition sense. That is, can a given function $f$ be written as $f = g \circ g$ (where $\circ$ is function composition)?For instance, the function $f(x) = x+10$ has a square root $g(x) = x+5$.Similarly, the function $f(x) = 9x$ has a square root $g(x) = 3x$.I don't know if the function $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ has a square root, but I couldn't think of any.Is there a way to determine which functions have square roots? To keep things simpler, I'd be happy just to consider functions $f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$.	20
1119	1117	Suppose $x^2 + (x+1)^2 = y^2$. We can rewrite it as $(2x+1)^2 + 1 = 2y^2$ or $(2x+1)^2 - 2y^2 = -1$.If $z=2x+1$ then we have $z^2 - 2y^2 = -1$. This is Pell's equation.Wikipedia article shows how to solve it.	12
1120	Summing ${\frac{1}{n^2}}$ over subsets of $N$.

(This is just the base-b representation of a real number.The case $b=2$ gives a bijection surjection $2^{N} \to [0,1])$.So we have sort of an in-between case here.Also, what if $A$,$B$:-are required to be finite sets?-are required to be infinite and disjoint?	9
1121	370	And when you get bored of reading, let the Catsters take over. (78 videos on Category theory!)	34
1122	1118	I showed you the link to the MO question mostly to convince you that this is a hard question.  I will "answer" it in the special case that $f$ is a bijection.  Recall that given a bijection $f : S \to S$, where $S$ is a set, a cycle of $f$ length $n$ is a set of distinct points $x, f(x), ... f^{n-1}(x)$ such that $f^n(x) = x$.  A cycle of infinite length is a set of distinct points $x, f(x), f^2(x), ...$.  It is not hard to see that $S$ is a disjoint union of cycles of $f$.Claim:  A bijection $f : S \to S$ has a square root if and only if there are an even number of cycles of $f$ of any given even length.  (For the purposes of this result, infinity is an even number; so there can be an infinite number of cycles, and you need to consider cycles of infinite length.)Proof.  First we show that any bijection with a square root has this property.  Let $g : S \to S$ be a bijection such that $g(g(x)) = f(x)$.  Then each cycle of $g$ corresponds to either one or two cycles of $f$, as follows.  If the cycle has odd length, it corresponds to one cycle of $f$.  For example, the cycle $1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 1$ of $g$ would correspond to the cycle $1 \to 3 \to 2 \to 1$ of $f$.  If the cycle has even length, it corresponds to two cycles of $f$.  For example, the cycle $1 \to 2 \to 1$ of $g$ would correspond to the pair of cycles $1 \to 1$ and $2 \to 2$, and the cycle $1 \to 2 \to 3 \to ... $ would correspond to the pair of cycles $1 \to 3 \to ... $ and $2 \to 4 \to ...$.  In particular, cycles of $f$ of odd length can come from cycles of $g$ one at a time or two at a time, but cycles of $f$ of even length can only come from cycles of $g$ two at a time.Now we show the reverse implication.  Given a cycle of $f$ of odd length $2k+1$, consider the corresponding cycle of $f^{k+1}$ of odd length.  Since $f^{2k+2} = f$ when restricted to this cycle, make this a cycle of $g$.  Given a pair of cycles of $f$ of the same even length, just weave them together to get a cycle of $g$.  I say "answer" instead of answer because it's not obvious if you can always find the cycle decomposition of some complicated bijection on an infinite set.  In any case, if $f$ isn't assumed to be a bijection this question becomes much harder; the analogue of cycle decomposition is much more difficult to work with.  I suggest you look at some examples where $S$ is finite if you really want to get a grip on this case; best of luck.	15
1123	855	Here's a very simplistic proof:$n^2 = 1 \pmod{24}$ for $n=1,5,7,11$, by checking each case individually.$(n+12)^2 = n^2 + 24n + 144 = n^2 \pmod{24}$.Therefore, $n^2 = 1 \pmod{24}$ when $n$ is odd and not divisible by $3$, and so $n^2-1$ is divisible by $24$ for these $n$. You don't need primality of $p$ here!A slight modification would be to use $1$ and $5$ as "base cases", and use the fact that $(n+6)^2 = n^2 + 12n + 36 = n^2 + 12(n+3)$, which is equal to $n^2 \pmod{24}$ when $(n+3)$ is even, i.e. $n$ is odd.	6

If so, how can I interpolate between two elements in the group?These are not subjects I know very little about. I apologize if I'm phrasing it in some way that sounds ridiculous.  	2

1127	Watchdog Problem	I just came up with this problem yesterday.Problem:Assume there is an important segment of straight line AB that needs to be watched at all time. A watchdog can see in one direction in front of itself and must walk at a constant non-zero speed at all time. (All watchdogs don't need to have the same speed.) When it reaches the end of the segment, it must turn back (at no time) and keep watching the line.How many watchdogs does it need to guarantee that the line segment is watched at all time? And how (initial positions and speeds of the dogs)?Note: It's clear that two dogs are not enough. I conjecture that four will suffice and three will not. For example, the below configuration doesn't work from 7.5 second if AB's length is 10 meters.Dog 1 at A               walks to the right with speed 1.0 m/sDog 2 at between A and B walks to the right with speed 1.0 m/sDog 3 at B               walks to the left  with speed 1.0 m/sOr it can be illustrated as:         A ---------------------------------------- B0.0 sec    1 -->               2 -->          <-- 32.5 sec              1 -->          <-- 32 -->5.0 sec                   <-- 31 -->          <-- 27.5 sec         <-- 3               <-- 21 -->Please provide your solutions, hints, or related problems especially in higher dimensions or looser conditions (watchdogs can walk with acceleration, etc.)	7
1128	1127	Three dogs is enought I think.Let the length of line segment be equal to 1 (with coordinates from 0 to 1).First dog: start position = 0, speed = +1/3Second dog: start position = 2/3, speed = +1/3Third dog: start position = 2/3, speed = -1/3After 1 second the position becomes similar.	9
1130	Preserving the extrema of one function after applying another	Suppose we have some function $f(x)$ with local extrema at $x_1, x_2, \dots$, and a second function $g(x)$ which is continuous, strictly increasing and non-zero everywhere over the range of the $x_i$. Will $g(f(x))$ have its local extrema at the same $x_i$ and no others?If so, are there any obvious loosenings of the constraints on $g$ for which this will remain true?(I'm really thinking of this in the context of signal processing, looking at transformations that preserve the visual structure of an image, but it seems like a general question that must have been trivially proved by someone 250 years ago...)	1
1131	1130	Since g is continuous and strictly increasing, its inverse $g^{-1}$ is a function and strictly increasing.  Since both are strictly increasing, $a<b\Leftrightarrow g(a)<g(b)\Leftrightarrow g^{-1}(a)<g^{-1}(b)$.  From this, it follows that $x_i$ is a local max (min) of g(f(x)) iff it is a local max (min) of f(x).If g were continuous and strictly decreasing, it would exchange local maximums and minimums (because $a<b\Leftrightarrow g(a)>g(b)$ and $a<b\Leftrightarrow g^{-1}(a)>g^{-1}(b)$).	3

1133	Natural derivation of the complex exponential function?	Bourbaki shows in  a very natural way that every continuous group isomorphism of the additive reals to the positive multiplicative reals is determined by its value at $1$, and in fact, that every such isomorphism is of the form $f_a(x)=a^x$ for $a>0$ and $a\neq 1$.  We get the standard real exponential (where $a=e$) when we notice that for any $f_a$, $(f_a)'=g(a)f_a$ where $g$ is a continuous group isomorphism from the positive multiplicative reals to the additive reals.  By the intermediate value theorem, there exists some positive real $e$ such that $g(e)=1$ (by our earlier classification of continuous group homomorphisms, we notice that $g$ is in fact the natural log).  Notice that every deduction above follows from a natural question.  We never need to guess anything to proceed.  Is there any natural way like the above to derive the complex exponential?  The only way I've seen it derived is as follows:Derive the real exponential by some method (inverse function to the natural log, which is the integral of $1/t$ on the interval $[1,x)$, Bourbaki's method, or some other derivation), then show that it is analytic with infinite radius of convergence (where it converges uniformly and absolutely), which means that it is equal to its Taylor series at 0, which means that we can, by a general result of complex analysis, extend it to an entire function on the complex plane.  This derivation doesn't seem natural to me in the same sense as Bourbaki's derivation of the real exponential, since it requires that we notice some analytic properties of the function, instead of relying on its unique algebraic and topological properties.  Does anyone know of a derivation similar to Bourbaki's for the complex exponential?  	14
1134	1125	The term "volume preserving" sounds a bit ambiguous to me: do you mean that your map preserves the total volume or do you mean that its differential at every point preserves volume (i.e. has determinant 1)? The former is weaker than the latter, and gives you more room for interpolation.In any case, there is a famous invariant of continuous maps $S^2\to S^2$ called the degree. Any two maps with the same degree are homotopic to each other. Being volume preserving (in the former sense) implies that the degree is $1$ (taking orientation into account!), so you can interpolate between any two volume preserving maps. However, the intermediate maps in this line of reasoning are only continuous, not necessarily diffeomorphisms. I'm confident that with a standard argument "approximate continuous functions by differentiable ones" you can get them to be differentiable, but I don't about "is diffeomorphism" and "is locally volume preserving" parts.	0
1135	If and only if, which direction is which?	I can never figure out (because the English language is imprecise) which part of "if and only if" means which implication.($A$ if and only if $B$) = $(A \iff B)$, but is the following correct:($A$ only if $B$) = $(A \implies B)$($A$ if $B$) = $(A \impliedby B)$The trouble is, one never comes into contact with "$A$ if $B$" or "$A$ only if $B$" using those constructions in everyday common speech.	10

1137	1130	You don't need to assume that $g$ is non-zero, and it could be strictly decreasing as well. Furthermore, the conditions on $g$ only need to hold on the image of $f$ (which doesn't need to the be whole of $\mathbb{R}$, for example).On the other hand, if $g$ has a local extremum at $y=f(z)$ and $f$ is strictly increasing around $z$, then you're obviously in trouble, because $g\circ f$ will have a local extremum at $z$. But having no local extrema is equivalent to being strictly monotonic.The only that might relax the conition on $g$ is that it has local extrema exactly where $f$ does and they "cancel each other out" or "amplify each other".	4

1149	1143	You just need to switch back and forth from the lexicographic meaning of the base-13 expansion of the number (think of having ABC instead of .-+) and the loaded meaning you give to the well-formed string as a base-10 number.An example of a number for which Conway base-13 function is 0 is 0.12-34++1+2-34..11111111111...where the leftmost . is the threedecimal point (that is, it has a semantic meaning), the three rightmost . mean that the base-13 representation has an infinite number of 1 (that is, they have a metameaning), and the other two . are "digits" of the number (that is, they have a syntactic meaning).An example of a number for which Conway base-13 function is not 0 is 0.12-34++1+2-34.11111111111...At that number, the function has value -34.11111111111...

1150	1064	Consider the set of reals x whose binary expansion, if you look only at the even digit places, is some fixed non-eventually-repeating pattern z. This is perfect, since we have branching at the odd digits, but they are all irrational, since z is not eventually repeating.You can draw a picture of this set, and it looks something like the Cantor middle third set, except that you divide into four pieces, and take either first+third or second+fourth, depending on the digits of z.Another solution: Begin with an interval having irrational endpoints, and perform the usual Cantor middle-third construction, except that at stage n, be sure to exclude the n-th rational number (with respect to some fixed enumeration), using a subinterval having irrational endpoints. By systematically excluding all rational numbers, you have the desired perfect set of irrationals.(Hi François!)	23

1153	954	The Laplace transform can be simply interpreted as a Wick rotated Fourier transform of a function $f(t)$ which vanishes for $t<0$. Wick rotation means (in this case) changing the frequency $\omega$ of the Fourier transform into an imaginary parameter $s=-i\omega$ of the Laplace transform.The reason for the inversion    $$\mathcal{L}^{-1} \{F(s)\} = f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\lim_{T\to\infty}\int\limits_{\gamma-iT}^{\gamma+iT}e^{st}F(s)\,ds, \qquad s=\Re(\gamma)$$to be a bit more complicated than the inverse Fourier transform (see wikipedia, to quote ) is this imaginary frequency which, if left purely imaginary, would lead to a non-convergent integral. The formula is still similar to the inverse Fourier transform. In fact I think (but have not verified) you could use it for that purpose to.	4

1155	1143	The idea of the Conway base-13 number is to find a function that is not continuous, yet if f(a)<x<f(b), then there is some c between a and b with f(c)=x. This a counterexample to the converse of the intermediate value theorem.The function is defined by encoding base-10 values in the tail (the digits left after skipping a finite number). We use +, -, . and the digits to represent an encoded number in the tail and require the encoded number to start with a + or -. In base 10, every number ending in an infinite number of 9s can be rewritten to end in an infinite number of 0s instead (ie. 0.999...=1.0). Similarly, we decide we will rewrite each Conway number ending in an infinite number of +, to ensure that each real number has a unique decimal representation.Each number can have up to one base-10 encoded value, which is the result of applying Conway's Base 13 function if it exists. If no such encoding exists for x(ie. + occurring infinite times in the expansion), then we define f(x)=0.We then show that for each a and b that we can find a c in between with an arbitrary encoded value. We first ensure the number being constructed is between a and b by copying enough digits from a and incrementing a digit that won't matter. This is easier because we have disallowed ending in an infinite number of +. We then concatenate the digits of the signed base-10 representation of the value we wish the function to have to those digits  we have already fixed.	3
1156	1143	I understand why the Wikipedia article uses the notation it does, but I find it annoying. Here is a transliteration, with some elaboration.Expand x ∈ (0,1) in base 13, using digits {0, 1, ... , 9, d, m, p} --- using the convention d = 10, m = 11, p = 12. N.B. for rational numbers whose most reduced expression a/b is such that b is a power of 13, there are two such expansions: a terminating expansion, and a non-terminating one ending in repeated p digits. In such a case, use the terminating expansion.Let S ⊂ (0,1) be the set of reals whose expansion involves finitely many p, m, and d digits, such that the final d digit occurs after the final p digit and the final m digit. (We may require that there be at least one digit 0--9 between the final p or m digit and the final d digit, but this does not seem to be necessary.) Then, every x ∈ S has a base 13 expansion of the form0.x1x2 ... xn [ p or m ] a1a2 ... ak [ d ] b1b2 ...for some digits xj ∈ {0, ... , p} and where the digits aj and bj are limited to {0, ... , 9} for all j. The square brackets above are only intended for emphasis; and in particular the n+1st base-13 digit of x is the final occurance of either p or m in the expansion of x.For x ∈ S, we define f(x) by transliterating the string format above. We ignore the digits x1 through xn , transliterate the p or m as a plus-sign or minus-sign, and the d as a decimal point. This yields a decimal expansion for a real number, either +a1a2 ... ak . b1b2 ... or −a1a2 ... ak . b1b2 ...according to whether the n+1st base-13 digit of x is a p or an m respectively. For x ∈ S, we set f(x) to this number; for x ∉ S, we set f(x) = 0.Note: this function is not computable, as there is no way that you can determine in advance whether the base-13 expansion of x ∈ (0,1) has only finitely many occurances of any of the digits p, m, or d; even if you are provided with a number which is promised to have only finitely many, in general you cannot know when you have found the last one. However, if you are provided with a number x ∈ (0,1) for which you know the location of the final p, m, and d digits, you can compute f(x) very straightforwardly.	11
1157	1057	You don't, as the group is not necessarily abelian! The group of upper triangular 3-by-3 matrices with ones along the diagonal and coefficients in the three-element field $\mathbb {Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ has exponent three, so your equation holds, but it is not abelian.There are lots of examples: the most famous ones are the Burnside groups $B(m,3)$: the group I described above is $B(2,3)$.	10
1158	1133	Some AssumptionsI will assume that you are ok with power series being used, just not Taylor's theorem. I will also assume you will allow us to observe a solution to a DE since you used it in your derivation. Defn A series of the form $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n\left(z-z_0\right)^n$ for $c_n,z,z_0\in\mathbb{C}$ is called a power series.Thm There is some $R\in[0,\infty]$ such that the power series above converges absolutely for all $z\in\mathbb{C}$ with $\mid z-z_0\mid < R$ and uniformly in $D\left(z_0,\rho\right)$ for all $\rho < R$. Further, the terms are unbounded for all $z$ with $\mid z-z_0\mid > R$.pf Use the geometric series' convergence.Lemma Inside the disk of convergence $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}nc_n\left(z-z_0\right)^{n-1}$ is the derivative of the power series.ConstructionFor power functions $y(z)=\sum c_nz^n$ can we find a unique solution to $y'(z)=y(z)$ in $\mathbb{C}$? We can observe that this implies $nc_n=c_{n-1}$. HenceDefn Let $E\left(z\right):=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}z^n$.Thm 1) $E'=E$2) $E\left(z_1+z_2\right)=E\left(z_1\right)E\left(z_2\right)$3)$E_{\mid_{\mathbb{R}}}$ is strictly increasing and $E(\mathbb{R})=(0,\infty)$4) $x\mapsto E(ix)$ sends $\mathbb{R}$ onto $\mathbb{T}$.5) There is some real $\pi>0$ such that $E\left(\frac{\pi}{2}i\right)=i$ and for all $z_1, z_2\in\mathbb{C}$, then $E\left(z_1\right)=E\left(z_2\right)$ iff $\frac{z_1-z_2}{2\pi i}\in\mathbb{Z}$6) $E\left(\mathbb{C}\right)=\mathbb{C}\setminus\left\lbrace 0\right\rbrace$.Note that all of these can be shown purely at the level of power series using no complex analysis. Further the proofs are not hard, if you want more details here let me know.Corollary $E$ is a homomorphism of the additive group $\mathbb{C}$ onto the multiplicative group with $\mathbb{C}\setminus\left\lbrace 0\right\rbrace$.ApplicationIf you care about loops(which I think you do!) lets observe that $\gamma(t)=e^{it}$ for $t\in[0,2\pi]$, is $\mathbb{T}$ (Note here that $\pi$ is simply the real number we found before, not some existential thing!). We could now push this to get winding numbers.Or you could use this definition of exponential, and the power series definition of inverse to get a (branchless) logarithm. In particular, you can show that the derivative of that fella is $\frac{1}{x}$. So we don't have to define it that way. :)CommentsI agree with you that the definitions of complex exponentials feel contrived and the logarithm is even worse. The branched logarithms is the only part of Palka that I dislike as a complex book. These definitions I can stomach, as they require no Dues ex Machina.	1
1159	107	[Edit.] I am editing my answer to try to give some more insight, prompted by comments on my original response. I hope to develop a deeper idea into what's going on here.The short answer is that what is important is not the size of the set of balls at any particular time, but rather how the set of balls changes; and ultimately what the limit of those sets are. The key is to determine what that limit is, and then determine how many balls are in that limiting set. The answer is that the limit is the empty set, which has size 0. The rest of this answer is devoted to describing this in some detail.Part of what I have added to my answer is to point out that although there are multiple ways of measuring convergence — in terms of various norms on characteristic functions — only one of these actually defines the limit of the sequence, and in this case the limit is well-defined.What matters is not the number of balls, but the set of ballsIn this problem, we have more than just a number of balls which changes with time. What's different is that each of these balls has a unique identity.This might not seem like it should matter, but it means that the state of the "system" is not a quantity of balls but a set of balls. That set has a certain size, but the size is a derived feature of the system; it follows from which particular set of balls is present. So it is important to determine what the limit of the sequence of sets is.Description of the problem in terms of setsLet's consider how the set of balls in the box change with time in the game you present. At step $n$, you add $2^n$ balls, and remove the $n$ lowest-numbered balls. The "state of the system" is given by the following sets:$S(0) = \{1\}$$S(1) = \{2,3\}$$S(2) = \{4,5,6,7\}$$S(3) = \{7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15\}$$S(4) = \{11,12,\dots,31\}$etc.Note that after step 1, the first ball is removed, never to be added again; so it is not an element of the final set. Similarly, at step 2, the second and third balls are removed, never to be added again; so they aren't elements of the final set. And so on. So... none of the balls are in the final set. So then it must be empty! It doesn't matter that the number of balls in the sequence are increasing; what matters is that the number of balls which will never again be in the box is also increasing, and in the limit includes all of the balls. We can make this more striking by considering, for each step $n$, the set of balls $I(n)$ which is in the set $S(t)$ for all $t \geq n$: that is, $I(n) = S(n) \cap S(n+1) \cap S(n+2) \cap \dots $.Because each ball is eventually removed, never to be added again; this means that$I(0) = I(1) = I(2) = \dots = \varnothing$So while the original description makes it look like, moment-to-moment, the final state of the box should be to hold infinitely many balls, a more "forward looking" approach shows that it's clear that the final state of the box is to be empty.An analysis in terms of characteristic functionsWe can contrast the "intuitive" answer of infinitely many balls in the box, and the more precise answer that there ultimately are no balls in the box, using characteristic functions: that is, we replace each set $S(n)$ by a function $f_n : \mathbb{N} \to \{ 0, 1\}$  which is $1$ for those integers belonging to $S(n)$, and $0$ otherwise.Consider the various $p$-norms on these functions. The cardinality of each set $S(n)$ is precisely equal to the $1$-norm of the function $f_n$ , which grows without bound. The fact that the 1-norm grows without bound — and in particular, the distance between the function $f_n$ and the zero function $\mathbf{0}$ in the $1$-norm grows without bound — is essentially the source of most people's intuition about this problem, and exactly the reason why they find it counterintuitive that the final set should be empty.But just as the size of a set is a derived quantity, the norm of a function — or of a sequence of functions — is also a derived quantity; and the norm of the limit of a sequence of functions is not necessarily the limit of the norms. In fact, the functions $f_n$ don't converge to anything, in any of the p-norms; it simply diverges to nothing in particular.But there is at least one notion of convergence which applies to the functions $f_n$, and that is point-wise convergence — the form of convergence which is the broadest, in the sense that it applies to the most cases (and with which all other notions of convergence must agree, if they show that a sequence of functions converges at all). We may simply show that for each $x$, we have $f_n (x) = 0$ for sufficiently large n. It then follows that the sequence $f_n$ converges to $\mathbf{0}$.The fact that the sequence $f_n$ doesn't converge to $\mathbf{0}$ under any of the p-norms doesn't matter; ultimately what matters is that the sequence converges point-wise, because what we're interested in is the cardinality of the limit itself, which is defined in terms of point-wise convergence. At worst, from a certain aesthetic point of view, one might say that it doesn't converge particularly gracefully (informally speaking) to $\mathbf{0}$; but it does indeed converge, and that is all that matters.So: using characteristic functions, which is ultimately equivalent to the sets described in the first place, one can show that the sequence of sets does converge, and what they converge to is the empty set. But take comfort that your intuition that they should not reflects a certain awareness of the concept of $p$-norms. :-)	26
1160	740	Here's an example of a strictly increasing function on ℝ which is continuous exactly at the irrationals.Pick your favorite absolutely convergent series ∑an in which all the terms are positive (mine is ∑1/2n) and your favorite enumeration of the rationals: ℚ={q1,q2,...}. For a real number x, define f(x) to be the sum of all the an for which qn ≤ x.	8
1161	1125	First, as others have pointed out, the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms will be infinite dimensional.For the second question, there is a beautiful technique known as Moser's trick which answers it.  Moser's trick, in fancy language, says that if (M,w) and (M,w') are two symplectic structures on the same manifold, and if [w] = [w'] in H^2(M;R) (de Rham cohomology), then there is a family of diffeomorphism f_t:M->M with f_0 = Id and such that f_1 pulls w' back to w.For a 2-dimensional compact, oriented manifold (like the sphere), we have H^2(M;R) = R (the real numbers), and a symplectic form is nothing but a nonzero element in R (which can be interpreted as the total volume).  Since in this setting, [w] = [w'] iff they both give the same signed volume, it follows from Moser's trick that the group of (signed) volume preserving maps is connected.If we consider unsigned volume, there will be 2 components to the group diffeomorphisms preserving the unsigned volume.  This is because, as others have pointed out, one has the notion of "degree" which shows the map x-> -x is not homotopic to Id, even through just continuous maps (not neccesarily volume preserving).  This shows there are AT LEAST two componenets.  There are at most two components because every volume preserving diffeo can be connected to Id or (x -> -x) by Moser's trick again.Edit:  I misspoke a little bit.  Moser's trick says that if you have a family w_t of symplectic forms, then there is a family of diffeomorphisms as I described above.  It's not clear to me that what I said (that it's enough to have [w] = [w'] in H^2) is enough to guarantee that there is a family of symplectic forms connecting them.  Further, it seems that Moser's trick only guarantees you have a path of diffeos which starts and ends at a volume preserving diffeo, but may not preserve volume for all time.However, in the case of S^2 (or any closed, orientable 2-manifold), I can patch things up. Given w and w', volume forms, with [w] = [w'] (i.e, they have the same volume), then the form w_t = tw + (1-t)w' is a path of symplectic forms which connects them.  For a fixed t, the form w_t is closed since it's a sum of closed forms (or, even easier, because it has top degree), and is nondegenerate because it's a volume form (integration shows the volume given is that of w).  The fact that the volume is constant for each w_t implies that the path of diffeos preserves volume for all time.(I wasn't able to immediately convince myself that in general, the convex sum of symplectic forms was nondegenerate, hence my initial hesitation.  In fact, I think that it need not be nondegenerate.)	3
1163	128	There is a fairly good exposition in Terry Tao's post, see Corollaries 4-6. Here is a sketch:We prove the more general statement: Let $p(n)= \chi n^d + a_{d-1} n^{d-1} + \cdots + a_1 n + a_0$ be any polynomial, with $\chi$ irrational. Then $p(n) \mod 1$ is equidistributed. Our proof is by induction on $d$; the base case $d=1$ is standard.Set $e(x) = e^{2 \pi i x}$. By the standard trickery with exponential polynomials, it is enough to show $$\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e(p(n)) = o(N).$$Choose a positive integer $h$. With a small error, we can replace the sum by$$\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (1/h) \left( e(p(n)) + e(p(n+1)) + \cdots + e(p(n+h-1)) \right).$$By Cauchy-Schwarz, this is bounded by$$\frac{\sqrt{N}}{h} \left[ \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}  \left( e(p(n))  + \cdots + e(p(n+h-1)) \right) \overline{ \left( e(p(n))  + \cdots + e(p(n+h-1)) \right)} \right]^{1/2}.$$Expanding the inner sum, we get $h^2$ terms of the form $e(p(n) - p(n+k))$. There are $h$ terms where $k=0$; these each sum up to $N$. For the other $h^2-h$ terms, the sum is of the form $\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e(q(n))$, where $q$ has leading term $\chi d n^{d-1}$. By induction, each of these sums is $o(N)$. So the quantity in the square root is$$hN+o(N)$$where the constant in the $o$ depends on $h$ and $\chi$. Putting it all together, we get a bound of$$N/\sqrt{h} + o(N).$$Since $h$ was arbitrary, this proves the result.	7

1166	1133	Also, if you are OK with power series, the Prologue to Walter Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis seems like exactly what you want.  It's a beautiful development of exp, as well as sin, cos, e, and even π, all quite organically.	2
1167	1164	Combinatorics is a subset of discrete mathematics.Combinatorics is the study of the ways discrete structures can be arranged/combined. Discrete mathematics is the study of all aspects of discrete structures (thus including combinatorics).	9
1168	1133	I think essentially the same characterization holds. The complex exponential is the unique Lie group homomorphism from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{C}^*$ such that the (real) derivative at the identity is the identity matrix.	13
1169	740	The Cauchy functionals, which satisfy the very simple equation f(a+b) = f(a)+f(b) for all real a,b.  These are either a line through the origin (the "nice" ones) or really "ugly" functions that are discontinuous and unbounded in every interval.  The latter are possible because the Axiom of Choice implies (actually is equivalent to) that infinite dimensional vector spaces have bases; i.e. the reals over the rationals have a Hamel basis.  A great explanation of all this (including the nice/ugly terminology) is in Horst Herrlich's monograph The Axiom of Choice.	2

1174	1079	If each function has a smallest period, and otherwise fits the conditions, then a proof may be forthcoming by attempting to compute the smallest period of the sum and failing.  However, things become unclear if there is no smallest period, as in the case of the characteristic function of the rationals.  Progress might be made in this case by decomposing such a function as an infinite sum of periodic functions, or at least give morecounterexamples to study.  (e.g. Write the characteristic function of the rationals asan infinite sum of functions of smallest period 1. )	2
1175	1079	As a first start, if $f+g$ is periodic the period cannot be rational w.r.t to the period of $f$  and $g$.Let us suppose that $T$ is the smallest period of $f(x)$, i.e. for all $x$, $f(x+T) = f(x)$.Similarly $S$ is the smallest period of $g(x)$, i.e. forall $x$, $g(x+S) = g(x)$. If $f+g$ had a period $Q$, and $\frac{Q}{T} = \frac{m}{n}$, we have that forall $x$, $f(x+nQ)+g(x+nQ) = f(x)+g(x)$. But $f(x+nQ)=f(x+mT)=f(x)$, Thus, forall $x$, $g(x+nQ)=g(x)$ and therefore $nQ$ is a period of $g$, which is impossible since it would mean that $\frac{T}{S}$ is rational.	2

1177	Comparing/Contrasting Cosine and Fourier Transforms	What are the differences between a (discrete) cosine transform and a (discrete) Fourier transform? I know the former is used in JPEG encoding, while the latter plays a big part in signal and image processing. How related are they?	8
1178	1127	I'll make the trivial answer: 1 dog at point A, facing point B, walking with a velocity of 0.  Presumably, you should really highlight that the dogs' velocities must be non-zero...this is the kind of side case that math people love to exploit. 	4
1179	123	Velocity addition in (special) relativity is not linear, but becomes linear when expressed in terms of hyperbolic tangent functions.More precisely, if you add two motions in the same direction, such as a man walking at velocity $v_1$ on a train that moves at $v_2$ relative to the ground, the velocity $v$ of the man relative to ground is not $v_1 + v_2$; velocities don't add (otherwise by adding enough of them you could exceed the speed of light).  What does add is the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the velocities (in speed-of-light units, i.e., $v/c$).  $$\tanh^{-1}(v/c)=\tanh^{-1}(v_1/c) + \tanh^{-1}(v_2/c)$$This is one way of deriving special relativity: assume that a velocity addition formula holds, respecting a maximum speed of light and some other assumptions, and show that it has to be the above.	10
1180	501	Disclaimer: I am not a finitist --- but as a theoretical computer scientist, I have a certain sympathy for finitism. The following is the result of me openly speculating what an "official" finitist response would be, based on grounds of computability.The short version is this: (a) It depends on what you mean by a 'number', but there's a reasonable approach which makes it reasonable to talk about finitistic approaches to real numbers; (b) What you can do finitisitically with numbers, real, rational, or otherwise, depends on how you represent those numbers.What is a number? Is −1 a number? Is sqrt(2) a number? Is i = sqrt(−1) a number? What about quaternions? --- I'm going to completely ignore this question and suggest a pragmatic, formalist approach: a "number" is an element of a "number system"; and a "number system" is a collection of expressions which you can transform or describe properties of in some given ways (i.e. certain given arithmetic operations) and test certain properties (e.g. tests for equality, ordering, etc.) These expressions don't have to have a meaningful interpretation in terms of quantities or magnitudes as far as I'm concerned; you get to choose which operations/tests you care about. A finitist would demand that any operation or property be described by an algorithm which provably terminates. That is, it isn't sufficient to prove existence or universality a la classical logic; existence proofs must be finite constructions --- of a "number", that is a representation in some "number system" --- and univserality must be shown by a computable test. Representation of numbers: How we represent the numbers matters. A finitist should have no qualms about rational numbers: ratios which ultimately boil down to ordered pairs. Despite this, the decimal expansions of these numbers may be infinitely long: 1/3 = 0.33333... what's going on here? Well, the issue is that we have two representations for the same number, one of which is finite in length (and allows us to perform computations) and another which is not finite in length. However, the decimal expansion can be easily expressed as a function: for all k, the kth decimal place after the point is '3'; so you can still characterize it precisely in terms of a finite rule. What's important is that there exists some finite way to express the number. But the way in which we choose to define the number (as a part of system or numbers, using some way of expressing numbers) will affect what we can do with it...there is now a question about what operations we can perform.--- For rationals-as-ratios, we can add/subtract, multiply/divide, and test order/equality. So this representation is a very good one for rationals. --- For rationals-as-decimal-expansions, we can still add/subtract and multiply/divide, by defining a new digit-function which describes how to compute the result from the decimal expansions; these will be messier than the representations as ratios. Order comparisons are still possible for distinct rationals; but you cannot test equality for arbitrary decimal-expansion representations, because you cannot necessarily verify that all decimal places of the difference |a−b| are 0. The best you can do in general is testing "equality up to precision ε", wherein you show that |a−b| < ε, for some desired precision ε. This is a number system which informally we may say has certain amount of "vagueness"; but it is in principle completely specified --- there's nothing wrong with this in principle. It's just a matter of how you wish to define your system of arithmetic.What representation of reals? Obviously, because there are uncountably many real numbers, you cannot represent all real numbers even if you aren't a finitist. But we can still express some of them. The same is true if you're a finitist: you just don't have access to as many, and/or you're restricted in what you can do with them, according to what your representation can handle.--- Algebraic irrational numbers such as sqrt(2) can be expressed simply like that: "sqrt(2)". There's nothing wrong with the expressions "sqrt(2) − 1" or "[1 + sqrt(5)]/2" --- they express quantities perfectly well. You can perform arithmetic operations on them perfectly well; and you can also perform ordering/equality tests by transforming them into a normal form of the type "[sum of integers and roots of integers]/[positive integer]"; if the difference of two quantities is zero, the normal form of the difference will just end up being '0'. For order comparisons, we can compute enough decimal places of each term in the sum to determine whether the result is positive or negative, a process which is guaranteed to terminate.--- Numbers such as π and e can be represented by decimal expansions, and computed with in this form, as with the rational numbers. The decimal expansions can be gotten from classical equalities (e.g. "infinite" series, except computing only partial sums; a number such as e may be expressed by some finite representation of such an 'exact' formula, together with a computable function which describes how many terms of the series are required to get a correct evaluation of the first k decimal places.) Of course, what you can do finitistically with these representations is limited in the same way as described above with the rationals; specifically, you cannot always test equality.	14
1181	Intuitive explanation of the Burnside Lemma	The Burnside Lemma looks like it should have an intuitive explanation. Does anyone have one?	10
1182	1181	As an example, we consider the number of ways of colouring a cube with n colours with uniqueness up to rotation. We call each unique colouring where rotations are not allowed a static colouring and each unique one where they are allowed a dynamic colouring. We define the the set of orbits to be the (disjoint) static colourings that correspond to each dynamic colouring. We will use rotations to mean a rotation that makes the cube occupy the same space, and as being unique if it is a unique function from the cube to the cube. This includes the identity rotation. Intuitively, the lemma says:Proposition 1. #Orbits * #Rotations = sum for each rotation r of #static colourings unchanged by this rotationWe will now consider each orbit O separately. Pick a static colouring c inside O. Suppose two (possibly equal) rotations p, q give the same static colouring, d, when applied on c. Then p^-1*q fixes d. Additionally, suppose r (possibly the identity) fixes d. p^-1*(p*r) will also fix d. So p*r will take c to d. Since p*r is different for each r, and p^-1*q is different for each q, the mapping functions are injective in both directions and there is a bijection between the q and r values.So, for each O, the number of rotations is the sum over each static colorings x in O times the number of rotations producing x. This can be rewritten as the sum over each rotation r of the number of static colourings in O fixed by r (due to the bijection in the previous paragraph). We get proposition 1 by adding over all O.The general proof is quite similar to this, except that it uses group theory.	5
1183	Division by imaginary number	I ran into a problem dividing by imaginary numbers recently. I was trying to simplify:$2 \over i$I came up with two methods, which produced different results:Method 1: ${2 \over i} = {2i \over i^2} = {2i \over -1} = -2i$Method 2: ${2 \over i} = {2 \over \sqrt{-1}} = {\sqrt{4} \over \sqrt{-1}} = \sqrt{4 \over -1} = \sqrt{-4} = 2i$I know from using the formula from this Wikipedia article that method 1 produces the correct result. My question is: why does method 2 give the incorrect result? What is the invalid step?	11
1184	1183	The incorrect step is saying:$\sqrt{4}/\sqrt{-1} = \sqrt{4/-1}$The identity:$\sqrt{a}/\sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a/b}$is only justified when $a$ and $b$ are positive.	23
1185	1183	This is exactly the same issue as in this question. Each non-zero complex number has two numbers that square to give it, with the same magnitude, but with opposite sign. When we define the square root function, we have to decide which of the roots we want. For positive numbers, it is obvious to choose the positive root. For negative number, we choose to have the positive imaginary values, although because of symmetry the choice doesn't mean much anyway.So, to see if the standard multiplication and division laws apply, then we have to consider domain the numbers are in. We already know they apply for non-negative real numbers. It is easy enough to verify that for negative numbers sqrt(a)*sqrt(b)=-sqrt(ab) and sqrt(a)/sqrt(b)=sqrt(a/b). We also see that, if a is positive and b negative, then sqrt(ab)=sqrt(a)sqrt(b), sqrt(a/b)=-sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) and sqrt(b/a)=sqrt(b)/sqrt(a).	1
